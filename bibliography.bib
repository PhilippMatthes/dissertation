	abstract = {Information on bicycle route choice is crucial for bicycle infrastructure planning. Emerging techniques of crowd-sourcing (e.g. FietsTelweek or CITY CYCLING) help to bridge the data gap. The collected data often illustratates the spatial distribution of bicycle traffic within cities and, thus, can help to monitore traffic. However, it is not suitable to forecast changes in traffic flows resulting from infrastructural measures. Traffic demand models are proper tools for that purpose but the utilization requires modelling and data expertise. Furthermore, most models are not based on observed route choice behavior. The contribution presents results of the "bikeSim" project, which intends to tackle that challenge. First aim of the study was to analyze bicycle route choice based on a) revealed preference GPS route data and b) open transport supply data. Second, a new simulation platform called "bikeSim" was implemented to provide an accessible and easy-to-use tool for bicycle traffic simulation. The contribution presents the results of the study, which initially focused on the city of Dresden (Germany). It reveals that bicycle route choice in Dresden depends on different factors such as slope, type of bicycle infrastructure, surface and its quality as well as speed of motorized traffic. The multinomial logit model (MNL) realistically reproduces bicycle route choice decisions (accuracy of 88.6\%). The implementation of the model into the bikeSim web-app enables planners to simulate changes in bicycle traffic resulting from changes in infrastructure (e.g. type of bike infrastructure) or on operational level (e.g. speed of motorized traffic). Thus, the route choice model and the webapp can significantly support decision-making in the planning process.},

The purpose of these devices is to assist motorists in decision-making at signalized intersections with real-time signal duration information. This study focused specifically on driver responses in the presence of a Red Signal Countdown Timer (RSCT). A Linear Mixed Effect (LME) model was developed to predict the effect of RSCT on the headway of the first vehicle waiting on a red signal. The model predicted 0.72s reduction in the headway of the first queued vehicle resulting from the presence of RSCT, while the observed difference in mean headway was 0.82s. This result is suggestive of a reduction in start-up lost time at signalized intersections, i.e., an improvement in signalized intersection efficiency when an RSCT is present.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Countdown signals for motorized vehicles, which are intended to ensure safety on the road and regulate motor vehicle speed limits at road intersections, are still considered a relatively novel concept. These signals have been adopted by only a few countries, and the number of cities that use them is limited. This review aims to summarize the effects of countdown signals on traffic safety and efficiency and to determine the consistency and differences of existing research propositions on the matter. Based on the review, considerable research presents evidently different conclusions in the areas of driver red-light running and traffic safety. Particularly, some studies propose that countdown signals reinforce traffic safety, whereas others consider that such signals adversely affect traffic safety. Meanwhile, related literature provides varying conclusions on the aspect of traffic efficiency for vehicle headway. At present, the number of studies conducted regarding the driving behaviors of motorists toward countdown-signalized intersections is insufficient. Accordingly, such inadequate diversity in research causes difficulty in completely assessing the benefits and disadvantages of countdown signals. In this paper, an important future research direction on microcosmic driving psychological and physiological data combined with macro-driving behavior is proposed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cycling is an effective solution for making urban transport more sustainable. However, bicycle networks are typically developed in a slow, piecewise process that leaves open a large number of gaps, even in well-developed cycling cities like Copenhagen. Here, we develop the IPDC procedure (Identify, Prioritize, Decluster, Classify) for finding the most important missing links in urban bicycle networks, using data from OpenStreetMap. In this procedure we first identify all possible gaps following a multiplex network approach, prioritize them according to a flow-based metric, decluster emerging gap clusters, and manually classify the types of gaps. We apply the IPDC procedure to Copenhagen and report the 105 top priority gaps. For evaluation, we compare these gaps with the city’s most recent Cycle Path Prioritization Plan and find considerable overlaps. Our results show how network analysis with minimal data requirements can serve as a cost-efficient support tool for bicycle network planning. By taking into account the whole city network for consolidating urban bicycle infrastructure, our data-driven framework can complement localized, manual planning processes for more effective, city-wide decision-making.},

Previous studies have demonstrated the potential environmental benefit in small-scale simulation scenarios. To assess the overall benefit, large-scale simulations are required. In order to ensure computational feasibility, the applied simulation models need to be simplified as far as possible without sacrificing credibility. Therefore this work presents the results of a sensitivity analysis and identifies gear choice and the distance from the traffic light at which vehicles are informed as key influencing factors. Our results indicate that a suboptimal gear choice can void the benefits of the speed adaptation. Furthermore, we present first results of a scale-up simulation using a real-world inner-city road network and discuss the range in which we expect the saving in fuel consumption to be in reality.},

	doi = {10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083073},
	abstract = {In recent years there has been significant interest in intelligent transportation technology that has specific energy and environmental benefits. Among these, dynamic eco-driving techniques on signalized corridors are being developed and employed with energy and environmental benefits (e.g., lower fuel consumption and emissions) in the general range of 5\% to 20\% for the individual vehicles that have the technology (the vehicles that are able to plan their velocity trajectories before they approaching an intersection, basing on the signal phase and timing (SPAT) information through dedicated short-range communication (DSRC)). The topic of this paper addresses the question on whether there are any additional network-wide energy/emissions benefits for the overall traffic from initial low-penetration rates of the technology. To this end, we have carried out a research study consisting of an extensive set of traffic simulations for an arterial corridor with different levels of congestion and different penetration rates of dynamic eco-driving technology. It is found that there are indeed indirect network-wide energy and emissions benefits for the overall traffic, even at low penetration rates of the dynamic eco-driving technology-equipped vehicles. In the experiments, the maximum fuel saving and emission reduction occurs during medium congestion (corresponding to traffic volume of 300 vehicles/lane/hour) and with low penetration rates (5\%, 10\% and 20\%). Under these conditions, the total traffic energy/emissions typically triple what is saved from the technology-equipped vehicles alone (e.g., total 4\% savings compared to 1.3\% savings).},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA) application implementation in a typical reference area, and presents the results of its performance analysis using an integrated cooperative ITS simulation platform. Our interest was to monitor the impacts of GLOSA on fuel and traffic efficiency by introducing metrics for average fuel consumption and average stop time behind a traffic light, respectively. For gathering the results we implemented a traffic scenario defining a single route through an urban area including two traffic lights. The simulations are varied for different penetration rates of GLOSA-equipped vehicles and traffic density. Our results indicate that GLOSA systems could improve fuel consumption and reduce traffic congestion in junctions.},

The control objectives are: timely arrival at green light with minimal use of braking, maintaining safe distance between vehicles, and cruising at or near set speed.

	abstract = {This brief deals with the improvement of a vehicle's pass-through of predictively known urban driving situations concerning its fuel consumption. Today's technology enables the prediction of information about traffic events. This information can be used to identify efficient driving strategies. The main aim is to reduce the dynamics in the velocity profiles of driving situations and with it the corresponding fuel consumption in urban traffic. An algorithm has been built to calculate fuel consumption optimized driving trajectories. Input parameters are temporal and spatial depending constraints of the driving situation as well as other restrictions like a speed-limit. The main objective of the function was to enable a situation adaptive reaction to every predictively known forthcoming traffic event. Thus an optimized driving trajectory can be steadily calculated for the next route section of the vehicle provided that predictive information about the traffic events are available. The higher the availability of information the better an optimization of the driving strategies will be possible. Fuel characteristics and other energetically relevant data for a real-world vehicle have been created by detailed simulation to evaluate the fuel consumption of the driving strategies. For demonstration purposes the common driving situation ”traffic light” was chosen. The fuel consumption calculated for the predictive driving strategies is compared to the consumption of a simulated average driver without predictive information. The calculated potentials have been verified by measuring the fuel consumption of an experimental vehicle for the simulated driving strategies.},

	abstract = {While traffic signals are necessary to safely control competing flows of traffic, they inevitably enforce a stop-and-go movement pattern that increases fuel consumption, reduces traffic flow and causes traffic jams. These side effects can be alleviated by providing drivers and their onboard computational devices (e.g., vehicle computer, smartphone) with information about the schedule of the traffic signals ahead. Based on when the signal ahead will turn green, drivers can then adjust speed so as to avoid coming to a complete halt. Such information is called Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA). Alternatively, the onboard computational device may suggest an efficient detour that will save the driver from stops and long waits at red lights ahead. This paper introduces and evaluates SignalGuru, a novel software service that relies solely on a collection of mobile phones to detect and predict the traffic signal schedule, enabling GLOSA and other novel applications. Our SignalGuru leverages windshield-mounted phones to opportunistically detect current traffic signals with their cameras, collaboratively communicate and learn traffic signal schedule patterns, and predict their future schedule. Results from two deployments of SignalGuru, using iPhones in cars in Cambridge (MA, USA) and Singapore, show that traffic signal schedules can be predicted accurately. On average, SignalGuru comes within 0.66s, for pre-timed traffic signals and within 2.45s, for traffic-adaptive traffic signals. Feeding SignalGuru's predicted traffic schedule to our GLOSA application, our vehicle fuel consumption measurements show savings of 20.3\%, on average.},

Availability of signal phase data is categorized into none, real-time only, and full-future knowledge. Dynamic Programming (DP) with full future knowledge of SPAT provides an energy efficiency maximum. The case with no knowledge of phase or timing represents an uninformed driver, and provides an energy efficiency minimum. In between, a signal phase prediction model which could use historically-averaged timing data and real-time phase data is evaluated, as it represents a technology which is available today. Results from a multi-signal simulation indicate that energy efficiency can be increased with probabilistic timing data and real-time phase data.},

	abstract = {Usually, vehicles' stop-and-go driving will consume more fuel and emit more CO2 than constant speed driving. To reduce vehicles' CO2 emissions, vehicles' travel should be smoothed by reducing the stop-and-go times. In this paper, a three-tier structure is proposed to realize dynamic traffic light control for smoothing vehicles' travel. In tier-1, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system is employed for collecting road traffic flow data and calculating the recommended speed. In tier-2, radio antennas are installed near the traffic lights. Road traffic flow information can be obtained by wireless communication between the antennas and ETC devices. In tier-3, a branch-and-bound-based real-time traffic light control algorithm is designed to smooth vehicles' travels. After smoothing vehicles' travels, more vehicles can pass intersections with less waiting time and fewer short-time stops; therefore, the vehicles' CO2 emissions can be reduced. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme performs much better than the adaptive fuzzy traffic light control method: The average waiting time, short-time stop times, and CO2 emissions are greatly reduced, and the nonstop passing rate is greatly improved.},

An eco-approach application uses Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) and intersection map information of signalized intersections to provide drivers with recommendations in order to encourage “green” driving while approaching, passing through, and departing the intersections. Upon receiving SPaT information, invehicle systems calculate and provide speed advice to the driver, allowing the driver to adapt the vehicle's speed to pass through the upcoming signal on green or to decelerate to a stop in the most eco-friendly manner. Eco-approach methods have been proposed and simulated showing promising results. In this study, both simulation experimentation and field operational testing have been carried out to demonstrate the eco-approach application and to quantify its potential fuel and carbon dioxide (CO2) savings. Furthermore, it has been shown that a communication platform based on a 4G/LTE network link and a cloud-based server infrastructure is effective and sufficient for this kind of application. It was found in both the simulation experiment and the field operational testing that on average 14\% fuel and CO2 savings can be achieved.},

	abstract = {The highest fuel consumption on urban arterials is associated with driving in congested traffic, characterized by higher speed fluctuations and frequent stops at intersections. One way to reduce excessive stop-and-go driving on urban streets is to optimize signal timings. More recently, new methods in traffic signal optimization have incorporated changes in drivers' behavior to achieve optimum performance at signalized intersections. Connected vehicles technology provides a two-way wireless communication environment enabling vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, which can be used for a variety of mobility and safety applications. One such application is called the green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA). This system uses timely and accurate information about traffic signal timing and traffic signal locations to guide drivers (through infrastructure-to-vehicle communication) with speed advice for a more uniform commute with less stopping time through traffic signals. A GLOSA implementation was evaluated for two types of traffic signal timing: predictable fixed-time signal timing and unpredictable actuated–coordinated signal timing. A two-intersection traffic network was modeled in VISSIM to achieve trustworthy results calibrated in the field. A comprehensive modal emission model was used to accurately estimate emissions. Experiments included various infrastructure-to-vehicle penetration rates and GLOSA activation frequencies. Results indicated that actuated–coordinated signal timings were not dependable for use in GLOSA systems. For fixed-time signals, higher penetration rates and more frequent GLOSA activations resulted in better traffic performance. GLOSA caused only minor improvements in fuel consumption, and average delay in vehicles stopped was improved significantly.},

We examine the impact of different equipment rates of both traffic lights and vehicles on environmental related metrics but also study how these systems can increase the comfort for drivers by reducing waiting times and the number of stops. We find that at low traffic densities these systems can meet all their goals and lower CO2 emissions by up to 11.5\% whereas in dense traffic several side-effects could be observed, including overall longer waiting times and even higher CO2 emissions for unequipped vehicles.},

In this article we compare performance of single- and multi-segment GLOSA approaches. In a single-segment GLOSA traffic signals are considered independently, i.e. the system provides vehicles with the optimal speed for the segment ahead of the nearest traffic signals. In a multi-segment GLOSA several signals in a sequence on a vehicle's route are taken into account, that is, vehicles receive speed advices for a set of segments ahead of the vehicle. Traveling time and fuel efficiency are used as performance measures. We demonstrate that as long as traffic conditions allow drivers selecting a wide range of speed (e.g. during free-flow) a multi-segment GLOSA results in much better performance when compared with a single-segment approach.},

The existing GLOSA approaches are single segment, that is, they consider traffic lights independently by providing vehicles with the optimal speed for the segment ahead of the nearest traffic lights. In this article we introduce a new approach-a multi segment GLOSA-according to which several lights in sequence on a vehicle's route are taken into account. The speed optimisation process is performed using a genetic algorithm. We assume that a vehicle has access to all traffic light phase schedules that it will encounter on its route. The route is composed of segments divided by traffic lights. The proposed GLOSA provides a driver with speed advisory for each segment according to selected preferences like minimisation of total traveling time or fuel consumption. We demonstrate, that in free-flow conditions such multi-segment GLOSA results in much better results when compared with single-segment approach.},

Applying SAE J2735 [1] Signal Phase and Timing (SPAT) and Map Data (MAP) messages in a real operational environment proved the feasibility of the chosen processing architecture and revealed technical and operational challenges to be mastered. The paper also explains why in this pre-series deployment transition the service is using C-ITS technology, but not DSRC as carrier medium due to commercial and organizational constraints of the operational setting. Furthermore it depicts the requirements of the communication from the automotive view.},

In addition, continuing urbanization all around the world makes this problem more severe especially at urban intersections. In this paper, we present a new green light optimal speed advisory (GLOSA), called the driver-centric GLOSA (DC-GLOSA), which advises the degree of acceleration/braking by comparing the current vehicle mobility with several reference mobility models. We argue that the DC-GLOSA can achieve higher fuel efficiency, better driving comfort, and less driver's distraction. To validate our argument, we conduct a real experiments at an intersection in Pusan National University campus. From the numerical results, we demonstrate that the DC-GLOSA can reduce 23.9\% of the intersection stopping time (IST) on average.},

	abstract = {Transit Signal Priority (TSP) makes Public Transport (PT) more competitive to the private car by facilitating the movement of PT vehicles across signalised intersections. However, the acceptance of TSP is limited, as its application can result in delays to the general traffic. In the future traffic signals will broadcast Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) status information to nearby vehicles. Thanks to this, TSP could be complemented with in-vehicle systems such as Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) and Green Light Optimal Dwell Time Advisory (GLODTA). They allow a bus to pass through signalised intersections during a green phase, without modifying signal timings. Therefore they do not create delays to the general traffic. The objective of this paper is to analyse how the two systems can complement TSP and to which extend they can be used instead of TSP. Using computational experiments we demonstrate that although signal priority provides greater travel time improvement, the two advisory systems offer similar advantages in terms of reducing the number of stops and delay time at traffic signals.},

Ride comfort is one of the key components defining the quality. In this article, we demonstrate how the comfort can be improved if buses use a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) driver assistance system. It allows a driver to adjust speed of the bus as so that it can arrive at the intersection when the light is green. It increases comfort of the passengers, reduces fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions of the bus. We use a multi segment GLOSA, i.e., several lights in a sequence on route of a bus are taken into account in order to calculate speed advice. Such approach is useful if busways are separated from traffic. The speed optimisation method is based on a genetic algorithm. In addition, performance evaluation of a single-segment GLOSA for bus operations in mixed traffic is also evaluated. Using computational experiments we demonstrate that when compared with conventional driving, where speed is not planned, the use of GLOSA results in significant improvement in ride smoothness.},

However, it can not guarantee that the vehicle could arrive at the intersection with the allowed maximum velocity. Therefore, in this paper, the augmented lagrangian genetic algorithm (ALGA) is proposed for searching the optimized speed curve in all possible speed curves, according to the minimal fuel consumption and the minimal running time, moreover the car following model is employed for handling the multi-vehicles problem. The simulation results indicate that, in free-flow conditions, the optimized value can save fuel consumption by 69.3 percent, save total trip time by 12.2 percent comparing to traditional method.},

This paper deals with the challenges of an extensive prediction of complete urban areas' traffic light networks. We introduce a real-time prediction algorithm and back-end implementation that is able to generate signaling predictions based on historical Signal Phase and Timing information (SPaT) for adaptive traffic lights of an entire urban area. Our approach is able to meet the requirement of dealing with high latency times for historical data and incomplete data sets. The proposed algorithm is able to provide predictions for 85\% of the adaptive traffic lights with available historical SPaT in 65\% of the time and thereby reaches an accuracy of 92\% to 97\%.},

	abstract = {Smart transportation, which is an important dimension of smart cities, includes both intelligent and “green” transportation solutions. Cycling, as one of the most sustainable forms of transportation, is and should be an important component of smart cities. Electric bicycles, which are the most popular electric vehicles, subscribe to this type of transportation. They have several advantages when compared with traditional bicycles but have issues that relate to battery-limited capacity and long periods of charging as well. Consequently, energy-efficient solutions for electric bicycles are of very high research interest. Research on vehicular-communications-based energy-efficient solutions for electric vehicles is still in the early stages. Among electric vehicles, electric bicycles distinguish themselves as a special class as they have different characteristics and road-related requirements. This paper proposes a novel vehicular-communications-based speed advisory system for electric bicycles. The solution recommends strategic riding (i.e., the appropriate speed) when bicycles are approaching a signaled intersection to avoid high-power-consumption scenarios. The proposed approach includes a fuzzy-logic-based wind-aware speed adaptation policy, as, among all the other vehicles, bicycles are mostly affected by wind. Experimental results based on a real testbed and extensive simulation-based testing demonstrate that, by using the proposed solution, significant energy savings are recorded. In addition, an analysis on comfort-related metrics shows that the proposed solution can also contribute to improving the cycling experience.},

These systems have been shown to work well with static traffic light programs, unfortunately, a large portion of traffic lights in inner cities are adaptive and can change their behaviour with almost no lead time. This paper presents and validates (using field tests and simulation) a method to help overcome this problem and forecast fully and semi-adaptive traffic lights. First, we transformed the state graph of the traffic light controller into a transition graph focusing on signal changes and their occurrence probability. We then reduced routing possibilities within the graph using real life observations and recorded detector data of the traffic light. We further optimized our system in terms of needed storage and computationally efficiency. Our results show that in 80\% of all cases we could predict signal changes 15s in the future with a high enough accuracy to enable GLOSA for adaptive traffic lights.},

For the system to reach its maximum potential, is is necessary to properly predict all different types of traffic lights, that is, also adaptive traffic lights where signals may change with lead times as short as 1 s. In previous work we presented an approach to predict these adaptive traffic lights using graph transformation. In this paper we demonstrate how to adequately parametrize such a graph based prediction approach and evaluate the accuracy of the signal prognosis. In a first step, we find feasible values for the proper creation of the prediction graph. This graph is the basis for all predictions and therefore directly influences the quality of the prognosis. We then assess the forecast in terms of correctness and deviation to measure the accuracy of the predictions. We were able to show a prognosis system with an accuracy of 95\% and a deviation of less than 2 s. Lastly, we discuss some criteria to compare different approaches of prognosis systems for adaptive traffic lights.},

An autonomous car can make more convenient, safer, and less energy intensive. In addition, Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems reduce the travel time and CO2 emission. In this paper, we propose a novel GLOSA, called R-GLOSA system to support to autonomous cars. We assume that an autonomous car can access to all traffic light schedules that it will encounter on its route. The route is divided into each segment according to traffic lights. In each segment, an autonomous car can communicate to Road Side Units (RSUs) distributed among the road. An autonomous car collects the road information transmitted by an RSU and then, it optimizes speed in order to arrive at the intersection when the light is green. The R-GLOSA system provides an autonomous car with speed advisory for each RSU's coverage. The simulation results show that an autonomous car using R-GLOSA system outperforms in terms of travel time and waiting time compared to using single-segment and multi-segment GLOSA system.},

This paper outlines how UVDs (N=60) interpreted and reacted to a driver with traffic light assistance system. We used a multi-driver simulator with three drivers driving in a car-following scenario. The lead driver was not a participant, but a confederate who was followed by two UVDs. The confederate was apparently equipped either with or without a traffic light assistance system. The traffic light assistance system consisted of two functionalities: a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory and a start-up assistance system with two different parametrizations. These functionalities aimed at preventing unnecessary changes in speed and reducing the start-up lost time after signal change. The results showed that UVDs benefited from the driving behavior of the confederate with traffic light assistance system. However, the assisted driving behavior was hardly understood and partly rated as aversive by the UVDs. We discuss how to enhance behavioral adaptation of UVDs. We also outline which negative consequences may result from encounters of driver with systems and UVDs. We assume that how UVDs react towards drivers with systems may be one factor contributing to a successful launch of such systems.},

Following unequipped vehicles’ drivers (UVDs) also adapt their driving behavior to the assisted one. On the other hand, safety issues can be found in encounters with UVDs who also perceive assisted driving behavior negatively. Therefore, in a multi-driver simulator study (N = 60 participants sorted in groups of n = 2 UVDs), we tested whether informing UVDs about the GLOSA of an assisted driver results in more behavioral adaptation of UVDs to the assisted driving behavior, less safety issues, and less frustration of UVDs. Two UVDs followed a lead vehicle driven by a confederate. The confederate was equipped with GLOSA and knew when traffic lights switched from green to red and, consequently, slowed down when approaching a green traffic light. The degree of information UVDs received was manipulated: The group “no information” did not receive any information. The group “information” knew about the equipment of the assisted confederate with GLOSA and the group “detailed information” received additional information about its functionality and benefit. Results show that UVDs of the group “detailed information” adapted their driving behavior to the assisted driver. However, these UVDs also showed smaller minimum time-to-collision (TTC) values indicating safety issues. Results are discussed and implications made with regard to providing information to UVDs and to further investigate these challenges in the context of autonomous vehicles.},

However, before any hardware/software infrastructure can be developed and implemented, a thorough phase of testing is warranted. Since actual vehicles and traffic conditions cannot be physically re-constructed, it is imperative that accurate simulation tools exist in order to model pragmatic traffic scenarios and communication amongst the participating vehicles. In order to realize this need of simulating V2X technology, we have created an integrated simulation environment that combines three software packages, VISSIM (traffic modelling), MATLAB (traffic management applications) and NS3 (communication network simulation). The combination of the simulators, has been carried out in a manner that allows on-line exchange of data amongst them. This enables one to visualize whether a traffic management algorithm creates the desired effect and also the efficacy of the communication protocol used. In order to test the simulator, we have modelled the Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA) application, whose objective is communication of the present traffic signal phase information to oncoming vehicles using a transmitting unit installed on the signal itself. This information will allow the vehicles to calculate the desired speeds necessary to cross the relevant intersection without stopping. Therefore, a “Green Wave” can be created for all vehicles without the need to coordinate traffic signal timers, which can be rather complex in a multiple intersection traffic corridor.},

	abstract = {In recent years, rapid technological breakthroughs in infrastructure-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure wireless communications have created the possibility of new concepts for traffic signal control. The green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA) approach uses traffic signal control information and the current position of a vehicle to recommend an appropriate speed for each vehicle, reducing the number of stops at traffic signals. Previous research mainly focused on the impact of GLOSA on the performance of movements on major streets. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of GLOSA on delay, capacity, and surrogate safety measures for vehicles that arrive from unsignalized side driveways and access roads. A highly calibrated and validated Vissim simulation model of a five-intersection segment of 3500 South, an urban corridor in Salt Lake City, Utah, was used as a test environment. Scenarios of various traffic loads and GLOSA activations have been defined and simulated. Outputs from Vissim were used to measure the impact of GLOSA. Vehicular trajectory files were postprocessed in the FHWA Surrogate Safety Assessment Model to analyze vehicular conflict data and thereby evaluate the traffic safety effects of GLOSA. The findings show that GLOSA often significantly affects delay of the side-street traffic. However, in general, GLOSA has only a minor impact on the number of conflicts. Regarding the impact of type of traffic control on GLOSA’s operations, the findings show that the fixed-time signals work better than actuated–coordinated signals, and road geometry and proximity of the signalized intersections affect the impact of GLOSA on the side-street traffic.},

	abstract = {Conceptually, a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system suggests speeds to vehicles, allowing them to pass through an intersection during the green interval. In previous papers, a single speed is computed for each vehicle in a range between acceptable minimum and maximum values (for example between standstill and the speed limit). This speed is assumed to be constant until the beginning of the green interval, and sent as advice to the vehicle. The goal is to optimise for a particular objective, whether it be minimisation of emissions (for environmental reasons), fuel usage or delay. This paper generalises the advice given to a vehicle, by optimising for delay over the entire trajectory instead of suggesting an individual speed, regardless of initial conditions – time until green, distance to intersection and initial speed. This may require multiple acceleration manoeuvres, so the advice is sent as a suggested acceleration at each time step. Such advice also takes into account a suitable safety constraint, ensuring that vehicles are always able to stop before the intersection during a red interval, thus safeguarding against last-minute signal control schedule changes. While the algorithms developed primarily minimise delay, they also help to reduce fuel usage and emissions by conserving kinetic energy. Since vehicles travel in platoons, the effectiveness of a GLOSA system is heavily reliant on correctly identifying the leading vehicle that is the first to be given trajectory advice for each cycle. Vehicles naturally form a platoon behind this leading vehicle. A time loop technique is proposed which allows accurate identification of the leader even when there are complex interactions between preceding vehicles. The developed algorithms are ideal for connected autonomous vehicle environments, because computer control allows vehicles’ trajectories to be managed with greater accuracy and ease. However, the advice algorithms can also be used in conjunction with manual control provided Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is available.},

In previous work we have shown that simulations tend to overestimate the communication quality to be expected in urban environments and that in a real-world test, IEEE 802.11p-based GLOSA cannot always reach the required information distance. Although multi-hop information dissemination can help alleviate this problem, it has not yet received much attention from the research community in the context of GLOSA systems. In this paper we present results from extensive field tests with almost 200 traffic light approaches. We find that two-hop dissemination of signal phase and timing information from traffic lights increases the maximum information distance by around 35\% and is able to support continuous updates even in challenging environments.},

In a first period, drivers had the information providing service disabled in order to establish a baseline behavior; after that initial phase, the service was activated. In both cases, data from smartphone and vehicle sensors was collected, including speed, acceleration, fuel rate, acceleration and brake pedal positions. We estimated the changes in the driving behavior which result from drivers' receiving the traffic signal timing information by carefully comparing distributions of acceleration/deceleration patterns through statistical analysis.

Prior studies have shown that tangible environmental benefits can be gained by communicating the driver with the signal phase and timing (SPaT) information of the upcoming traffic signals with fixed time control to the driver. However, similar applications to actuated signals pose a significant challenge due to their randomness to some extent caused by vehicle actuation. Based on the framework previously developed by the authors, a real-world testing has been conducted along the El Camino Real corridor in Palo Alto, CA, USA, to evaluate the system performance in terms of energy savings and emissions reduction. Strategies and algorithms are designed to be adaptive to the dynamic uncertainty for actuated signal and real-world traffic. It turns out that the proposed EAD system can save 6\% energy for the trip segments when activated within DSRC ranges and 2\% energy for all trips. The proposed system can also reduce 7\% of CO, 18\% of HC, and 13\% of NOx for all trips. Those results are compatible with the simulation results and validate the previously developed EAD framework.},

This paper presents a driving advisory system for vehicles approaching traffic lights that is based on the use of a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system and evaluates its impact on traffic flow characteristics. This system, which assumes the existence of a connection with the traffic light ahead, calculates the distance required to pass through the intersection without stopping during the remaining green signal time. The required distance is then projected onto the road surface as a green planar rectangle shape through a head-up display (HUD). As long as the vehicle is traveling on the green rectangle, the drivers will not need to make a complete stop or accelerate again in order to meet the onset of a green signal. Assuming that all vehicles are equipped with our proposed system, traffic simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of the scheme. Numerical analyses showed that a higher fuel efficiency and lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were achievable, even under high-density traffic conditions, by combining the full and partial assistance levels of our proposed system.},

	abstract = {The use of green light optimal speed advisory (GLOSA) systems is seen as a key application for achieving more environmentally friendly, time-efficient, and safer traffic flows at signalized intersections. In previous papers, the authors have proposed a GLOSA system that informs drivers of the most appropriate position for their vehicle instead of their optimal speed. This paper reports on a performance evaluation of our proposed GLOSA system after application to morning rush-hour traffic flow in a simulation of a real-world signalized intersection. A performance evaluation of this numerical simulation showed that our GLOSA system increased the time headway of vehicles and decreased their deceleration rates in the vicinity of the signalized intersection. In addition, the use of the system moderately increased fuel efficiency without affecting vehicle travel time. From these results, it can be concluded that our proposed GLOSA system has the potential to create safer traffic flows in real-world signalized intersections without degrading traffic efficiency.},

Approaching vehicles are given speed recommendations based on current and future traffic light signal phase timings. These systems have been widely evaluated by means of simulation and, while most research focuses on the impact assessment of GLOSA along with environmental influences, minor attention was drawn to the holistic technical evaluation of included sub-modules and implementations. In this extended version of our IEEE VNC 2016 publication, we present a holistic concept for the technical evaluation of IEEE 802.11p-based GLOSA systems. We first give a comprehensive survey on GLOSA systems and studies all around the world and identify remaining problems. We introduce metrics to cover the whole spectrum of GLOSA operations and particularly focus on (modeling) problems we encountered in the field that are often not taken into consideration in simulation studies. We demonstrate how this concept can be used to evaluate the real-world GLOSA system tested in the European Commission co-funded field trial DRIVE C2X. Results derived from Field Operational Test (FOT) data show that our metrics are well-suited to assess the performance of the GLOSA system, and also to identify sources of potential problems or bottlenecks. Based on our findings, we argue that most GLOSA simulation studies are too optimistic in terms of communication performance. Lastly, we give recommendations on how real-world GLOSA systems can be further improved to support a sufficient level of performance.},

Frequent stops for red traffic lights at intersections are experienced by cyclists as a major inconvenience. This study introduces a green wave concept for cyclists, with focus on the traffic management and control aspects under cooperative intelligent transport systems applications. It especially addresses increasing stability of the adaptive control system, to overcome the drawbacks of both actuated and traditional adaptive control (which are too unpredictable for a green wave speed advice). In addition, solutions for avoiding increased delays for other traffic are investigated, as generally result from a classic green wave approach (with only fixed-time control) and traditional adaptive control. This study introduces an adaptive control algorithm for a real-time model-predictive controller and implements a plan-deviation cost function to address stabilisation. Simulation results show that the developed method increases stability of the adaptive control system, limits extra delays for other traffic and yields a high success rate for the green wave concept.},

	abstract = {This project focuses on a mode of transportation that is currently left out of V2X (vehicle-to-everything) conversations: bicycling. The project demonstrates how university researchers, city traffic engineers, and signal-controller manufacturers can come together to give bicyclists the same technology appearing on modern vehicles: Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA). GLOSA allows motorists to set their speed along corridors to maximize their chances of catching a “green wave” (i.e., not being forced to stop as they travel through the corridor). This project demonstrates how GLOSA can be used by bicyclists in the same way it is used by motorists on a busy car and bike corridor feeding the University of Oregon (UO) campus. The project attempts to answer two questions: (1) Can GLOSA information be conveyed to a phone carried by a bicyclist? (2) Can the information be presented in an effective, reasonable and safe manner using the interfaces available on the phone? For the former, the authors discuss their approach to combining (a) information provided by the city’s traffic office in terms of signal timing-tables with that of (b) a real-time traffic feed from the McCain Transparity server. They discuss a system architecture that they developed to use the real-time feed to keep an up-to-date view of signal state (current phase and its start time). However, if the feed was lost, the system continued to operate with its last known state information, potentially obtained by signal reset by the main office. The system architecture, and the app that employs it, uses the phone global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer sensors to keep an accurate view of the rider’s location, direction and speed. For their second question, the authors describe an app they developed and a set of trials they ran to test it. The overall results are positive. Testing revealed that the GLOSA-based app was effective, reasonable and safe on the test site.},

Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) is one the many use-cases of C-ITS. GLOSA aims to minimize trip time and fuel consumption by providing vehicles, via a wireless channel, with specific information to calculate an advisory speed to be respected when approaching a traffic light. However, Wireless communications are prone to packet loss and delay which could considerably impact applications and user experience. In this paper, we study the impact of network performance on the efficiency of GLOSA. We compare two different strategies to find advisory speeds, one that aims at reducing trip time and the other at reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emission. Results show different impact of network performance on GLOSA depending on the strategy that is followed.},

Traditional GLOSA system only considers the SPaT (Signal Phase and Timing) of traffic light. However, two another important factors, namely queuing effect and actual tracking error of drivers, are seldomly considered, which degrades the actual performance of the GLOSA system. Intelligent connected vehicles based on V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) have great application potential in solving this problem. In this study, firstly, a vehicle queue length estimation method based on V2I technology is proposed to predict the effective green light time. Secondly, a hierarchical GLOSA system is developed, where the upper layer provides the global recommended optimal speed aiming at minimizing energy consumption, while the bottom layer provides the modified recommended speed considering the driver's tracking error. Finally, the tracking error of the driver when executing the recommended speed is derived based on the real-world experiment. Corresponding simulation and field test platforms are also established. Results show that compared with the traditional GLOSA system, the improved GLOSA system considering the vehicle queuing effect and driving error can effectively improve the energy-saving performance of the vehicle.},

In this paper, we present a new method to calculate the optimal driving speeds based on traffic light data. To this end, a detailed formulation for the optimization problem is presented for a multi-segment route, based on an electric vehicle (EV) and traffic light models in an urban environment. Since this formulation results in a nonconvex optimization problem, a relaxation procedure is applied with a low calculation time. By using this procedure, a dynamic real-time speed advisory algorithm is developed. Numerical simulations showed improved performance over benchmark techniques. In particular, the proposed Dynamic-GLOSA solution’s performance was shown to be very close to that with a brute-force optimal solution but with a much shorter calculation time and has significant potential for energy saving.},

This article shares the concept with these studies but turns the spotlight on cyclists. It examines the problem of finding optimal speed trajectory for a cyclist in signalised urban areas. Unlike the available studies on motorised vehicles which predominantly designed for pre-defined, fixed traffic lights timing, this article uses an algorithm based on stochastic dynamic programming to explicitly address uncertainty in traffic light timing. Moreover, through a comprehensive set of simulation experiments, the article examines the impact of the speed advice’s starting point as well as the cyclist’s willingness for changing his/her speed on enhancing the performance. The proposed approach targets various performance metrics such as minimising the total travel time, energy consumption, or the probability of stopping at a red light. Hence, the resulting speed advice can be tailored according to the personal preferences of each cyclist. In a simulation case study, the results of the proposed approach is also compared with an existing approach in the literature.},

	url = {https://elib.dlr.de/142057/},
	abstract = {In recent years the percentage of cyclists in urban road traffic has constantly been growing all over the
world. Therefor increasing the importance to consider cyclists in traffic control, especially at signalized
intersections. Current traffic light controls (TLC) are often mainly constructed to optimize green
periods for motorized traffic, considering cyclists only insufficiently at most. Because of this, we have
developed a cooperative traffic light control (CTLC), which can consider cyclists as well as motorized
traffic equally, by using the future-oriented technology V2I. Cyclists are equipped with a V2I capable
Mobile Devices to enable their detection when approaching the intersection thereby request their
required phase. Furthermore, the green period for cyclists can be adjust by their expected arrival times
at intersections. The Modul for considering cyclists from CTLC, which has the potential to be integrated
in any kind of TLC, was first integrated in an existing TLC. Thus, the TLC is able to consider cyclists as
well as other common road users. The CTLC Mobile Devices of the cyclist additionally provides a
GLOSA-function, which informs the cyclists about the signal time of their required signal group during
the approach, and provides an estimated speed recommendation accordingly. The main purpose of
the CTLC is to reduce waiting times and stop numbers for cyclists. With the additional aim to minimize
and prevent negative effects on the remaining traffic. For evaluation a python code of the CTLC was
connected to an SUMO-network of an actual intersection in Braunschweig via TraCI. First simulations
expose positive effects for cyclists, reducing waiting times as well as the amount of required stops
while conserving or marginally enhancing the remaining traffic flow.},

	abstract = {The objective of eco-drive technology is to reduce fuel consumption and resulting emissions using advances in communication and traffic control technologies with capability to support infrastructure-to-vehicle connection in a signalized network. On the human factors side, there is growing interest across the world in advising drivers to take eco-drive actions by effectively using the green phase of the signal cycle time to save fuel and reduce emissions. This paper describes a large-scale real-world research project in Ottawa (Ontario, Canada) on this subject. The technology and methods that support the green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA) system were refined and all 1,178 traffic signals in the city were equipped to connect with a fleet of vehicles. Field study data were analyzed for speed trajectories, fuel consumption, and GLOSA compliance. Greenhouse emissions and fuel cost changes were computed. An anonymous questionnaire study investigated driver perception of the usefulness of the signal data displayed on an in-vehicle unit as advice on driving adjustment decisions made under prevailing traffic conditions. The over 65\% compliance with GLOSA and the results of the driver questionnaire were mutually consistent. The fuel saving amounted to 7.6\% but was adjusted to 5\% because of uncertainties in daily vehicle travel. The reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent and fuel cost reported in the paper are based on a 5\% adjustment. These results can be used for cost?benefit studies. Also, simulation-based research projects can verify their findings with the real-world experience reported in this paper.},

How does it evolve with respect to the Market Penetration Rate (MPR) of connected vehicles? Here are some questions raised by this paper with a focus made on Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) strategy. Such a system, based on V2I communication, aims at providing speed advice/recommendations when approaching an intersection to adjust speed and enhance fuel consumption. The message is displayed on the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of the connected vehicles and a response is expected from the driver. This paper derives its interest in the response behaviour of the driver to HMI. It develops a two-stage methodology based on (i) Field Operational Test to collect realistic inputs (e.g., response rate, delay, deceleration profile, etc.) and (ii) a simulated environment used for extending the findings to non-observed cases (e.g. higher MPR). Besides, the methodology that is well-fitted for generic evaluation and comparison of pilots sites’ conclusions, one further contribution lies in the process to select the explaining factors. Factors are targeted among features of (i) the road configuration (e.g. number of lanes), (ii) the service configuration (e.g. activation distance), or (iii) the individual route choice and traffic conditions. Among others, it is highlighted that the activation distance plays a significant role in the response behaviour and, depending on the cycle duration, a short activation distance might be completely inefficient, while a true environmental impact requires high MPR.},

	abstract = {In this study, a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system for buses (B-GLOSA) was developed. The proposed B-GLOSA system was implemented on diesel buses, and field tested to validate and quantify the potential real-world benefits. The developed system includes a simple and easy-to-calibrate fuel consumption model that computes instantaneous diesel bus fuel consumption rates. The bus fuel consumption model, a vehicle dynamics model, the traffic signal timings, and the relationship between vehicle speed and distance to the intersection are used to construct an optimization problem. A moving-horizon dynamic programming problem solved using the A-star algorithm is used to compute the energy-optimized vehicle trajectory through signalized intersections. The Virginia Smart Road test facility was used to conduct the field test on 30 participants. Each participant drove three scenarios, including a base case uninformed drive, an informed drive with signal timing information communicated to the driver, and an informed drive with the recommended speed computed by the B-GLOSA system. The field test investigated the performance of using the developed B-GLOSA system considering different impact factors, including road grades and red indication offsets, using a split-split-plot experimental design. The test results demonstrated that the proposed B-GLOSA system can produce smoother bus trajectories through signalized intersections, thus producing fuel consumption and travel time savings. Specifically, compared to the uninformed drive, the B-GLOSA system produces fuel and travel time savings of 22.1\% and 6.1\%, on average, respectively.},

	abstract = {Information-sharing between traffic signals and connected vehicles can enhance the traffic conditions in signalized intersections. We propose a straightforward application, heads-up green, with the aim to inform queuing connected vehicles about a switch from red to green. In this way, the drivers’ reaction time is expected to be reduced and the number of vehicles that can pass the intersection during a cycle is thereby increased. Unlike the applications Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA), time-to-green and time-to-red, there is no need for predictions of future traffic signal states. Therefore, heads-up green can be used in traffic actuated and adaptive control strategies in signalized intersections without loss in precision. A simulation-based evaluation of a typical Swedish intersection with a traffic actuated controller is performed to evaluate the traffic performance. The main goal as been to show on the potential to use heads-up green to increase traffic efficiency in signalized intersections. Additionally, different reaction times to the information from heads-up green has been investigated. The results show that with heads-up green it is possible to improve the travel time by up to 15\% at high demand levels when queues are frequently observed. The improvements are largest with 100\% connected vehicles, but significant improvements of 5-15\% are observed also for lower shares of connected vehicles. At high demand levels, travel times are decreased already at small reductions in the reaction time. Hence, there is a potential to improve traffic efficiency already when small changes in reaction time can be achieved with heads-up green.},

The main outcome of the proposed solution is a full y flexible traffic control system applying industrial PLC while ensuring a standardized V2X protocol. As a demonstrative HiL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) example, exploiting the elements of the traffic management system at the ZalaZONE Automotive Proving Ground, a GLOSA (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) scenario is presented with the developed SPaT/MAP V2X communication realizing a global optimum traffic control solution. The more, the whole framework is designed in a way that it is capable of using mixed reality components for testing purposes and realizing a digital twin for traffic lights. The method of virtualization for V2X communication is introduced using a co-simulation framework of three common software tools (SUMO, Veins, and OMNeT++).},

Best results for the prediction of traffic actuated signals were obtained by methods based on decision trees. We came to the conclusion that extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) shows the best performance for the two traffic signal systems under consideration.

	abstract = {A signal phase and timing (SPaT) message describes the current phase at a signalized intersection for each lane, together with an estimate of the residual time of that phase. Accurate SPaT messages can be used to construct a speed profile for a vehicle that reduces its fuel consumption as it approaches or leaves an intersection. This paper presents SPaT estimation algorithms at an intersection with a semi-actuated signal, using real-time signal phase measurements. The algorithms are evaluated using high-resolution data from an intersection in Montgomery County, MD, USA. The algorithms can be readily implemented at signal controllers. This paper supports three findings. First, real-time information dramatically improves the accuracy of the prediction of the residual time compared with the prediction based on historical data alone. Second, as time increases, the prediction of the residual time may increase or decrease. Third, as drivers differently weight errors in predicting “end of green” and “end of red,” drivers on two different approaches may prefer different estimates of the residual time of the same phase.},

	abstract = {As vehicle communication standards mature, protecting vulnerable road users (VRUs) using vehicle communication technology is looming as a promising and useful application. The current vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication as stipulated by the standard such as SAE J2735 implies that it is mainly the vehicles that take the responsibility for VRU protection. In this VRU protection framework, user devices are essentially beacons that transmit Personal Safety Messages (PSMs). Upon receiving these PSMs, the drivers (or autonomous vehicles) take necessary measures to protect them. We, however, believe that the road users could also use the information about nearby vehicles to avoid dangerous situations. This paper discusses how the most distracted road user type, i.e., smartphone users, can use the Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) from nearby vehicles to notice approaching danger and take appropriate defensive actions. We build a complete prototype based on the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) standards, and demonstrate how it can be used by pedestrians to notice imminent danger even while they are gazing at the smartphone screen.},

	abstract = {Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) have seen increased interest in recent years, with several ongoing activities and first practical implementations. While clearly V2X-communication will play a significant role in all C-ITS deployments, several key components, such as the wireless communication technology and the message formats, are still evolving. This calls for a modular approach when designing C-ITS infrastructure, especially when considering a real world urban environment. Such environments are characterized by heterogeneous traffic light hardware and traffic management systems. This paper focuses on the modular architecture of the C-ITS pilot in Dresden. For example, a highly flexible communication stack is developed for this special purpose. It fully supports the message types standardized by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) on the one hand, while on the other hand allowing the rapid implementation and test of novel message types and contents. This went hand in hand with the development of a modular roadside unit, enabling the rapid implementation of service applications on its central processing unit. In combination with a cloud-based backend, a real-time C-ITS service platform with a hybrid communication concept is developed. This paper presents a modular architecture and best practice guidelines based on experiences of the C-ITS pilot in Dresden. First results of research topics, such as latency measurements, are shown. The ongoing C-ITS deployment in Dresden is part of the initiative "Synchrone Mobilität 2023", which aims at advancing Intelligent Transport Systems. Focusing on automated and connected driving in urban areas, the research and development projects under its umbrella initiate scientific and technological developments and provide comprehensive test facilities. Automated and connected driving in urban areas requires not only simulations and test drives on test sites but also enormous testing effort under real traffic conditions. The Dresden Testbed offers outstanding conditions to conduct real-world test with a multitude of test kilometers and the experience of different traffic scenarios.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, a lot of applications have been developed for Vehicular Ad Hoc NETworks (VANETs) to exchange information between vehicles. However, VANET is basically a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) characterized by intermittent connectivity, long delays and message losses especially in low density regions [1]. Thus, VANET requires the use of an infrastructure such as Roadside Units (RSUs) that permits to enhance the network connectivity. Nevertheless, due to their deployment cost, RSUs need to be optimally deployed. Hence, the main objective of this work is to provide an optimized RSUs placement for delay-sensitive applications in vehicular networks that improves the end-to-end application delay and reduces the deployment cost. In this paper, we first mathematically model the placement problem as an optimization problem. Then, we propose our novel solution called ODEL. ODEL is a two-steps technique that places RSUs only in useful locations and allows both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication: (i) the first step is comprehensive study that looks for the RSUs candidates locations based on connectivity information, and (ii) the second step uses genetic algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm to reduce the number of RSUs based on the deliverance time requirement and the deployment cost. We show the effectiveness of our solution for different scenarios in terms of applications delay (reduced by up to 84\%) and algorithm efficiency (computation performance reduced by up to 79\% and deployment cost reduced at least by up to 23\%).},

The related optimization problem is solved using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. The experimental analysis considers real scenarios in the city of Malaga, using realistic traffic information and real antennas. The reported results indicate that the proposed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is able to compute accurate trade-off solutions for the problem, significantly outperforming a greedy approach based on the ideas previously applied in the related literature.},

Reliable signal timing estimation integrated into Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory systems is one of the keys to minimizing unnecessary braking and accelerating in front of traffic lights. In this paper, we present experiments based on recorded real-world process data of traffic signals to predict the switching times of traffic actuated signals using machine learning. Traffic lights sign a limited number of signal combinations. We summarize these combinations into sets to obtain one feature depicting the signal state. This paper focuses on whether the inclusion of the (estimated) state as an input feature can achieve higher accuracy for the estimation of the switching times than those based only on signal information. Implementing XGBoost and Bayesian Networks, we found that a higher accuracy and a lower root mean square error are achieved by using states. Whether the actual or estimated next state improves the quality of the prediction, the most depends on the degree of traffic dependency and traffic load of the traffic light.},

	abstract = {With an ever-increasing population growth in cities around the world, continuous production of all kinds vehicles by manufacturers, and the number of vehicles on the roads will only continue to rise. This naturally leads to increased traffic congestion, especially in large metropolitan areas and even more so during peak rush hour time. This phenomenon constantly puts pressure on researchers, city officials, and urban planners to continue to improve traffic management systems in ways that are safer and economically more efficient. In order to address this evolving problem, a number of studies have been conducted that have resulted in some notable improvements such as designated lanes for emergency vehicles in urban areas. However, even with these lanes, often the ideal target-times for emergency vehicles to reach their destinations is hard to achieve. A new method which seeks to address this issue is called Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This method can help solve the problem by integrating existing technology with the current infrastructure. In this paper, our goal is to compare different methods for managing traffics, namely Traffic Light Systems (TLS): Static and Dynamic TLS, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Internet of Things (IoT). In the latter method, traffic data are quickly acquired and sent to Big Data for processing and mobile applications AKA User Interface (UI) to estimate traffic density in various areas in order to suggest alternative ways to alleviate traffic.},

This approach substantially reduces computational burden by using an approximation to the value function of the dynamic programming and reinforcement learning to update the approximation. We investigate temporal-difference learning and perturbation learning as specific learning techniques for the ADP approach. We find in computer simulation that the ADP controllers achieve substantial reduction in vehicle delays in comparison with optimised fixed-time plans. Our results show that substantial benefits can be gained by increasing the frequency at which the signal plans are revised, which can be achieved conveniently using the ADP approach.},

	abstract = {Background
Many cities across the world are beginning to shift their mobility solution away from the private cars and towards more environmentally friendly and citizen-focused means. Hamburg, Oslo, Helsinki, and Madrid have recently announced their plans to become (partly) private car free cities. Other cities like Paris, Milan, Chengdu, Masdar, Dublin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Bogota, and Hyderabad have measures that aim at reducing motorized traffic including implementing car free days, investing in cycling infrastructure and pedestrianization, restricting parking spaces and considerable increases in public transport provision. Such plans and measures are particularly implemented with the declared aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These reductions are also likely to benefit public health.
Aims
We aimed to describe the plans for private car free cities and its likely effects on public health.
Methods
We reviewed the grey and scientific literature on plans for private car free cities, restricted car use, related exposures and health.
Results
An increasing number of cities are planning to become (partly) private car free. They mainly focus on the reduction of private car use in city centers. The likely effects of such policies are significant reductions in traffic-related air pollution, noise, and temperature in city centers. For example, up to a 40\% reduction in NO2 levels has been reported on car free days. These reductions are likely to lead to a reduction in premature mortality and morbidity. Furthermore the reduction in the number of cars, and therefore a reduction in the need for parking places and road space, provides opportunities to increase green space and green networks in cities, which in turn can lead to many beneficial health effects. All these measures are likely to lead to higher levels of active mobility and physical activity which may improve public health the most and also provide more opportunities for people to interact with each other in public space. Furthermore, such initiatives, if undertaken at a sufficiently large scale can result in positive distal effects and climate change mitigation through CO2 reductions. The potential negative effects which may arise due to motorized traffic detouring around car free zone into their destinations also need further evaluation and the areas in which car free zones are introduced need to be given sufficient attention so as not to become an additional way to exacerbate socioeconomic divides. The extent and magnitude of all the above effects is still unclear and needs further research, including full chain health impact assessment modeling to quantify the potential health benefits of such schemes, and exposure and epidemiological studies to measure any changes when such interventions take place.
Conclusions
The introduction of private car free cities is likely to have direct and indirect health benefits, but the exact magnitude and potential conflicting effects are as yet unclear. This paper has overviewed the expected health impacts, which can be useful to underpin policies to reduce car use in cities.},

We describe the rationale, prerequisites, barriers, facilitators and strategies for car free cities. We describe 9 prerequisites to facilitate the transition towards becoming car free. Compact cities may be easier to refit to car free cities than sprawled cities. The main challenges will be how to change existing infrastructure that was mainly designed for cars to infrastructure for active and public transport, and how to change people’s perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. Retail interest and the car industry may be some of the biggest barriers. More research on cities in the vanguard of becoming car free is needed to urge this transition. Some cities have initiated strategies to create car free spaces. There is a need for creating good and feasible strategies and scenarios, and research evidence which can facilitate the move towards healthier cities.},

	abstract = {The future of cycling is about to change. At least, this is apparent if we are to believe the multitude of innovators, start-ups, incumbent industries, policy actors and consultants proposing to harness the power of digital techniques to improve and transform cycling experiences, infrastructures, and gadgets. This ‘smartification of cycling’ is a phenomenon that is increasingly attracting attention and a variety of interests, fuelled both by the processes of transitioning to smart mobility and a boom of attention to cycling in cities worldwide. However, proposed cycling futures, both implicit and explicit, receive little critical scrutiny. Here, we fill this gap by mapping smart cycling innovations and their key features. We examine how innovations are believed to change the way cycling is practiced, made sense of and governed. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we analyse 86 website texts of smart cycling innovations and systematically outline changes envisioned by innovators. Having identified tensions between and within a range of promised futures, we conclude that smart cycling futures are multiple and contested, just as cycling presents are. Therefore, we propose a number of questions for further research to advance a more nuanced understanding of the range of futures of smart cycling in academic thinking and potentially to support decision-making at different levels of governance. Understanding diverse, contested, embodied and embedded cycling presents is part and parcel of imagining and co-creating (smart) cycling futures.},

Efficiency gains can be achieved via combination of new technologies, such as electrification, connectivity, and automation. Energy conservation focuses on reducing the total miles travelled by private cars. Supporting modal shift to public transport (PT) is the essential element of that strategy. It starts with policy support enabling time and space prioritisation of PT vehicles. Next, the emerging technologies can optimise performance and comfort of PT vehicles by making the best use of the assigned resources. This article shows how these technologies can reduce GHG emissions directly, as well as indirectly by making PT an attractive choice boosting patronage.

This study aims to identify the core factors affecting the development of ITS in Vietnam and as a result, form a branching database to approach the standards of SC. To achieve the stated purpose, materials are collected for research in developing and developed countries which comes from official sources including scientific articles, conference papers, books, and opinions from experts (from 2010 to 2020). This study identified 28 factors affecting the development of ITS projects. These factors are divided into 5 main groups namely the lack of undivided attention from the government, financial constraints, inadequate/incomplete transport infrastructure, the over-development of urbanization, the readiness and integration for ITS, which are analyzed depending on their influence. This study adds to the body of knowledge by offering new insights and contributes toward a greater understanding of mobility in a smart city. Furthermore, to guarantee sustainable ITS development, the digital infrastructure ecosystem should be extensively discussed. As a result, it created a useful measurement tool for government agencies, planners, and traffic system designers to help them self-assess and make action plans now or in the near future.},

Many errors and biases that occur when measuring with GNSS in the field. Theoritically, there are some errors and biases that can be eliminated or subtracted by strength of satellite geometric. One factor to get a good satellite geometric is to increase the number of satellites received by receiver. In general, the more number of satellites received, the better the geometric satellites received by receivers. The development of receiver technology is currently able to capture GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou signals at one time. Thus the receiver can receive many satellites and finally the shape of geometric satellite becomes better. HiTarget V30 is one of the latest GNSS technology on the market today. This receiver is capable of receiving GPS signals, GLONASS and BeiDou at one time of observation. This research will compare the accuracy of positioning using GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou satellite.},

	abstract = {Autonomous driving vehicles require both a precise localization and mapping solution in different driving environment. In this context, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology is a well-study settlement. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and camera sensors are commonly used for localization and perception. However, through ten or twenty years of evolution, the LIDAR-SLAM method does not seem to have changed much. Compared with the LIDAR based schemes, the visual SLAM has a strong scene recognition ability with the advantages of low cost and easy installation. Indeed, people are trying to replace LIDAR sensors with camera only, or integrating other sensors on the basis of camera in the field of autonomous driving. Based on the current research situation of visual SLAM, this review covers the visual SLAM technologies. In particular, we firstly illustrated the typical structure of visual SLAM. Secondly, the state-of-the-art studies of visual and visual-based (i.e. visual-inertial, visual-LIDAR, visual-LIDAR-IMU) SLAM are completely reviewed, as well the positioning accuracy of our previous work are compared with the well-known frameworks on the public datasets. Finally, the key issues and the future development trend of visual SLAM technologies for autonomous driving vehicles applications are discussed.},

Existing precise localization systems based on the global navigation satellite system cannot always provide lane-level accuracy even in open-sky environments. Map-based localization using high-definition (HD) maps is an interesting method for achieving greater accuracy. We propose a map-based localization method using a single camera. Our method relies on road link information in the HD map to achieve lane-level accuracy. Initially, we process the image—acquired using the camera of a mobile device—via inverse perspective mapping, which shows the entire road at a glance in the driving image. Subsequently, we use the Hough transform to detect the vehicle lines and acquire driving link information regarding the lane on which the vehicle is moving. The vehicle position is estimated by matching the global positioning system (GPS) and reference HD map. We employ iterative closest point-based map-matching to determine and eliminate the disparity between the GPS trajectories and reference map. Finally, we perform experiments by considering the data of a sophisticated GPS/inertial navigation system as the ground truth and demonstrate that the proposed method provides lane-level position accuracy for vehicle localization.},

This paper presents a method estimating a set of likely map-matched hypotheses containing the correct solution with a high probability. This addresses the problems encountered when using a high definition map when a large number of ambiguities arise. These occur for instance, when only inaccurate prior information on position is available at initialization. The method uses lane-level accurate maps with dedicated attributes, such as connectedness and adjacency, and an automotive Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver assisted with dead-reckoning (DR) sensors. GNSS can be so inaccurate that map-matching relies mainly on DR estimates, the GNSS fixes being used as uncertain estimates with protection levels. This paper proposes a formalization of the map-matching integrity problem as well as a sequential method using a Particle Filter providing a reliable set of map-matched hypotheses.

Additionally, in safety applications or in those with critical performance requirements (such as satellite-based electronic fee collection), integrity becomes a key word for the navigation community. In this scenario, it is clear that a navigation system that can operate at the lane level while providing integrity parameters that are capable of monitoring the quality of the solution can bring important benefits to these applications. This paper presents a pioneering novel solution to the problem of combined positioning and map matching with integrity provision at the lane level. The system under consideration hybridizes measurements from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, an odometer, and a gyroscope, along with the road information stored in enhanced digital maps, by means of a multiple-hypothesis particle-filter-based algorithm. A set of experiments in real environments in France and Germany shows the very good results obtained in terms of positioning, map matching, and integrity consistency, proving the feasibility of our proposal.},
