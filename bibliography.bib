	abstract = {This paper reports a before-and-after study which evaluated the difference in driver response along an approach of a signalized intersection installed with a green signal countdown device (GSCD). The main purpose of a GSCD is to provide drivers with a countdown timing that would help them make informed stopping/crossing decisions during the critical phase-change period. Using a special-purpose data logger, four continuous days of before-and a series of four continuous days at various months’ after-GSCD data were collected. The findings indicated that red-running violations were significantly reduced by about 65\% at 1.5-month after-GSCD but its effectiveness tended to dissipate over time as the violation numbers had bounced back to almost the before-GSCD level. The dwindling effect of GSCD in curbing red-running violations in the longer term generally occurred under high traffic flows. On the other hand, the numbers of vehicles choosing to stop during the onset of amber had increased significantly by about 6.2 times at 1.5-month after-GSCD installation. The increase in red-stopping was however sustainable over the longer term, albeit a relatively small reduction was noted. The findings indicated that GSCD was practically effective in encouraging red-stopping actions under heavy traffic flows. In effect, one may conclude that the longer term performance of GSCD would only help to encourage stopping but not curbing red-violations.},

Currently, cities are dominated by individual motorized transport with associated problems of air pollution, congestion, noise and traffic injuries. This paper argues that the redistribution of space is key in achieving modal split change and the greening of urban environments. It holds that taking road space from cars is justified from social, health, environmental and economic viewpoints. Yet, any change in urban transport cultures has to consider the automobile, which has instrumental as well as symbolic and affective functions. City planners are advised never to argue against the car, and to frame change in ways that reduces resistance by drivers and automotive lobbies.},

	abstract = {Literature has suggested that angle/rear-end collisions would arise from the reality that motorists and motorcyclists tended to accelerate aggressively in response to the remaining seconds of green signal countdown device (GSCD). One safety concern, while GSCD has gradually been removed for safety in Taiwan, is pedestrian green signal countdown device (PGSCD) that is used by approaching motorists and motorcyclists that may adopt the information to travel aggressively – an unintended consequence that is detrimental to safety. Research has reported that there appeared no negative effect of PGSCD on motorist behaviours but the effect on motorcyclists’ behaviours has been rarely investigated. Using video/speed cameras, the current research investigates motorcyclists’ RLV (red-light violation) behaviours. The descriptive analyses indicate that the percentage of RLV at PGSCD intersection is higher than that at typical intersection, and the violating motorcycles appear to have higher travelling speeds at PGSCD intersection. Several interaction terms were examined with the binary logit framework, and the results reveal that several factors are associated with RLV, notably male/young riders, moped/large motorcycle users, higher approaching speeds of motorcycles, those with tropical helmets, and lower traffic volume. Similar determinants of early-start behaviours (for those waiting at reds and could view the PGSCDs for the crossing pedestrians at the same time) were identified. Implications of the research findings, the concluding remarks, and recommendations for future research are finally provided.},

	abstract = {Objective: Rear-end accidents are the most common accident type at signalized intersections, because the diversity of actions taken increases due to signal change. Green signal countdown devices (GSCDs), which have been widely installed in Asia, are thought to have the potential of improving capacity and reducing accidents, but some negative effects on intersection safety have been observed in practice; for example, an increase in rear-end accidents. Methods: A microscopic modeling approach was applied to estimate rear-end accident probability during the phase transition interval in the study. The rear-end accident probability is determined by the following probabilities: (1) a leading vehicle makes a “stop” decision, which was formulated by using a binary logistic model, and (2) the following vehicle fails to stop in the available stopping distance, which is closely related to the critical deceleration used by the leading vehicle. Based on the field observation carried out at 2 GSCD intersections and 2 NGSCD intersections (i.e., intersections without GSCD devices) along an arterial in Suzhou, the rear-end probabilities at GSCD and NGSCD intersections were calculated using Monte Carlo simulation. Results: The results suggested that, on the one hand, GSCDs caused significantly negative safety effects during the flashing green interval, especially for vehicles in a zone ranging from 15 to 70 m; on the other hand, GSCD devices were helpful in reducing rear-end accidents during the yellow interval, especially in a zone from 0 to 50 m. Conclusions: GSCDs helped shorten indecision zones and reduce rear-end collisions near the stop line during the yellow interval, but they easily resulted in risky car following behavior and much higher rear-end collision probabilities at indecision zones during both flashing green and yellow intervals. GSCDs are recommended to be cautiously installed and education on safe driving behavior should be available.},

	abstract = {Integrating landmarks into the communication of wayfinding services is an established strategy that enhances wayfinding efficiency and user confidence. In this context, we present a strategy for selecting landmarks for route descriptions that keeps the number of selected landmarks small. We argue that limiting the number of landmarks to be referred to in a route description can help to reduce the length and complexity of the description. Instead of selecting a different landmark located at each decision point, we reduce the selection to landmarks that can be seen from multiple decision points. We preferably choose those landmarks that are already clearly visible when approaching a decision point, thus optimizing advance visibility. We formalize an optimization problem that requires that at least one selected landmark is visible from each decision point. While minimizing the number of selected landmarks, we aim to maximize their advance visibility along the route. We show that our problem is NP-hard and present both an exact approach that uses integer linear programming and a greedy heuristic. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach can substantially reduce the number of selected landmarks compared to a baseline strategy. We determine a compromise between the optimization criteria and show that the heuristic generates high-quality solutions within a short running time.},

Sustainable forms of transport, such as cycling, are a key issue for cities across the globe, including smart cities, while transport is increasingly becoming part of the Internet of Things (IoT). This article contributes to an understanding of how cars and bicycles are discussed in this context. To do so, 39 relevant EC policy documents (2014–2018) were identified and examined through keyword searches and rigorous document analysis. The results show how the vast majority of policy discussions in this area revolve around cars (including autonomous cars and smart vehicles), while cycling is hardly considered, with a strong affinity between IoT and cars. In addition, recent EC policy debates take place more around IoT than around Smart Cities, while sustainability is not considered much in the IoT context. The conclusion highlights the implications of sustainable urban modes of transport such as cycling being absent from IoT/smart debates, including lack of policy visibility and funding opportunities, underlining the significance of this research, and it also makes policy suggestions for addressing these issues and for future research.},

Recently, some alternative transportation means have been leveraged as sustainable options for such challenges, which has brought bicycles to a more relevant setting. Besides the sometimes obvious benefits of adopting bikes for transportation, technologies around the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm have been advocated as important supportive tools to boost smart cycling initiatives. Actually, new technologies can be exploited to improve the efficiency of bike paths and parking spots, while reducing accidents and enhancing the cycling experience of the users. Therefore, in this highly vibrating scenario, this article facilitates the understating of current research trends and promising developments, surveying and classing recent works. Since there is a global interest for the promotion of cleaner and more sustainable solutions in large cities, this survey can be valuable when supporting new developments in this highly relevant research area.},

	abstract = {This study proposes an urban Bikeability Index (BI) to assess and prioritise bicycle infrastructure investments, and in turn, improve accessibility for cyclists. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we construct a BI that addresses particularities of the roads in cities of the Global South and considers the preferences, perceptions and socioeconomic characteristics by type of cyclist. Second, a tool is developed for decision-makers to prioritise investments in bicycle infrastructure, considering the estimated BI and expected cyclist flows. The methodology is structured into two stages. The first stage constructs a new BI following three steps. First, we select the most important factors and components related to biking behaviour. Second, we estimate weights for selected factors and components by using a discrete choice model to analyse users’ perceptions based on results from ranking surveys. Third, we estimate the BI by type of cyclist as a weighted additive function, which are equivalent to the probabilities calculated using the discrete choice model. The second stage proposes a direct demand model to prioritise bicycle infrastructure investments based on the estimation of BIs, and expected flows of cyclists. We applied the methodology to Barranquilla, Colombia and ranked different bicycle infrastructure investments for increasing bicycle demand in the city. The results suggest that even though primary roads are currently associated with low BI values due to high rates of road accidents, they tend to be preferred by cyclists. The presence of adequate bicycle infrastructure is the most crucial factor for people who frequently cycle for sport, while traffic safety and security are the most critical factors for those who cycle to work.},

Results show that all groups of interest show higher, but not fundamentally different, route requirements. In this context, lower speed limits for motorized transport are very important for people cycling with children, and older adults. In addition, women and those traveling with children attach significantly higher value to separated bike infrastructure. These results show that vulnerable road users benefit stronger from a bike-friendly road infrastructure than the cyclist population as a whole.},

This model confirms the significant and positive effects of station presence and station number, each of which have a lag of about 9 months. Moreover, empirical results highlight public transport accessibility as a significant moderator of the bike-sharing effect, suggesting a complementary relationship between bike-sharing and public transport in mobilizing tourists within an urban environment.

	abstract = {Accurate modelling of the health and environmental benefits of non-recreational transport cycling requires information about its effects on the use of other transport modes. Relevant research has not focussed on cycling for transport in a general context (as opposed to bikeshare), nor allowed for multi-modal trips. The influence of trip- and personal-characteristics on whether cycling replaces car-driving have yet to be considered. The present study aimed to address these research gaps. An on-line cross-sectional survey was completed by 1525 Australians who cycle for transport at least once per week. For the most recent trip completed (at least partly) by bicycle participants provided trip distance, and percentage travelled by car, public transport (PT), and walking. They also provided the percentage travelled by each mode for the same trip before taking up transport cycling; and a hypothetical future trip when riding is not possible. Compared to the same trip before, fifty percent of recent trips reduced car use, and around 1/3 eliminated a 100\%-car trip. Reduced car use was significantly less likely for trips under 7.5km, commuting, females, respondents under 55, and regular cyclists. Reduced car use was less likely for respondents who started riding because it is flexible, and more likely for those who started riding to avoid parking. Car-use was reduced by an average of 6.2km per trip, and each bicycle-km cycled replaced 0.5 car-km. Participants report that since taking up cycling, even when they cannot use their bike, they use cars less and use PT more compared to before they took up cycling. Results suggest that previous studies underestimated the extent to which transport cycling replaces car travel, and highlights trip types and population groups to target with cycling promotion strategies. Information about the per-trip and per-bicycle-km replacement of car, PT and walking may be used for more accurate estimation of the benefits of transport cycling than has hitherto been possible.},

	abstract = {The safety level of signalized intersection depends greatly on drivers’ decision-making behaviors, which are significantly influenced by the time-reminder strategy before amber of the signal device. However, previous related studies are mainly based on the statistical results from the field data rather than explore the influence mechanism of the signal device on the signalized intersection's safety level. Therefore, this study aims to find out how these three typical signal devices with various time-reminder strategies, i.e., common signal device (CSD), green signal flashing device (GSFD), and green signal countdown device (GSCD), affect drivers’ decision-making processes during the period from the end of the green phase to the onset of the red phase (i.e., G2R) and then evaluate their safety performance from the aspect of RLR violations. Firstly, an overall decision-making framework during G2R is presented to describe the driver–signal interaction and encloses four decision-making processes, which can be analyzed and modeled based on the field data collected from six signalized intersections in Changsha, China. Empirical analyses show that the time point of decision-making before amber under GSCD is the earliest and that under CSD is the latest, which can also be modeled and reproduced by back propagation neural network (BPNN). After that, five binary logistic regression models are developed to determine the safety effect during other various processes and results show that red-light-running (RLR) violations are not only dependent on the range of dilemma zones (DZ) but also substantially on stop and go decisions of those vehicles in DZ, both of which are the potential cause and direct factors to RLR violations and found to be significantly affected by the time-reminder strategy of the green signal device. Finally, although GSCD stimulates the drivers in DZ to choose to cross the intersection during amber, which produces a higher RLR risk compared with CSD and GSFD, the intersection with GSCD is verified to own the lowest RLR violations due to its greatly positive effect in cutting down the range of DZ.},

	abstract = {Most research concerned with cyclists’ safety has been focused on the crash risk (i.e. their objective safety). However, there has been a growing interest in the perceived level of this risk (i.e. the subjective safety of cyclists). Crash risk and subjective risk perception in urban cycling appear to be mostly well aligned. For example, reduced speed limits have been found to reduce both objective and subjective risks (although there is also evidence for some incongruences). This absolute number of incidents could be misleading, as it does not account for potential differences in cycling volume (i.e. cyclists are likely to prefer streets with reduced speed limits). Thus, it may be important to adjust the absolute number of incidents relative number to the local cycling volume. In this research, we investigate the relation of cycling crashes and subjective risk perception (operationalized through reports from a crowd-sourcing project) for different types of cycling infrastructure and different speed limits, while accounting for the local cycling volume. We find that the absolute number of VGI reports and crashes can be misleading: whereas the absolute incident numbers, for example, suggest few benefits of cycling lanes and tracks, adjusting for the cycling volume reveals an increase of both objective and subjective safety as compared to streets without cycling infrastructure. We also identify situations where cyclists apparently underestimate the crash risk (i.e. on cycleways opposing the cars’ traveling direction, and at streets with a speed limit of 30 km/h intersecting streets with higher speed limits). Additional research is required to understand the sources of these discrepancies, and how to make cyclists aware of them.},

	abstract = {In the recent decade, numerous scientific studies investigated the utility of GPS data to bridge the existing data gap in cycling. Almost all studies faced the lack of representativeness of data because the participation in data collection was influenced by self-selection of participants. Thus, the GPS data were biased by dominant user groups. However, the difference between biased samples and representative data has not been quantified, yet, as there was no data from representative selected samples that could be used for comparison. The present work investigates whether and how cycling behaviour of different groups differs. It furthermore examines the parameters cycling behaviour depends on. For this purpose, nearly 200 cyclists were selected according to representativeness regarding age, gender and type of cyclist. The study participants recorded their ways using a GPS smartphone app during a two-week field study. Data analysis revealed little influence of the user group on cycling behaviour, only. In contrast, the variables age, gender and trip purpose show a strong influence on cycling speed, distance, acceleration and frequency. The study results point out the need for representative data collection in GPS-based studies on cycling.},

We present a new urban mobility concept, Connected Swarm Cycling, that creates a group of people cycling together for a while in a common direction or destination. We assume that the concept of Swarm Cycling can significantly change the mobility behaviour of citizens and will be a building block of green mobility for sustainable cities in the future. Utilizing an OSRM11http://project-osrm.org/ routing service with support of trip intersection computing, the system inducts the cyclists into a cycling swarm. The swarms are formed automatically via peer-to-peer connection when cyclists come in proximity, and the information of the swarm and individual cyclist will be synchronized within the swarm via a Nearby Mesh Network. Supporting the implicit interaction within or between swarms, smart wearables are utilized to realize use cases like swarm member identification or signalling in case of merging or splitting of swarms. In this paper, we also present a technical description of our system, including the protocol and network model to support the coordination and synchronization within the swarms.},

The system indicates the remaining time of the current traffic light phase through an expiring bar. This is intended to help cyclists adjust their speed in order to cross the traffic lights when green, and consequently optimize their cycling flow. We conduct a natural field experiment to analyze the system’s impact on cycling flow and safety, and find a statistically significant impact on cycling flow. The number of cyclists that have to stop at the red lights decreases by 6.6\%. The data also indicate positive effects on traffic safety. The results of the natural field experiment confirm and put into perspective the feedback of an accompanying online survey. The Leezenflow system can thus help city planners to promote cycling, thereby enabling more sustainable mobility.},

	abstract = {The initiatives of cycling infrastructure enhancements around the world reveal a consistent interest in promoting cycling to transition toward sustainable lifestyles and safe multi-modal commuting. Accordingly, proposals for cyber-physical systems for smart cycling are also growing, providing solutions to make cycling a safer and better experience for cyclists. However, most existent solutions address single cyclist problems rather than group cycling issues. It is evident that further work is needed to improve safety and comfort for groups of cyclists traveling on busy urban bicycle paths or dedicated bicycle highways. In this paper, we position the concept of technology-assisted cooperative cycling. We introduce a platoon-based cyclist cooperative system that provides safe and efficient coordination for groups of cyclists. We present the results of an experimental prototype tested on real cyclists as well as comprehensive simulations that test the performance of our solution in different scenarios. We demonstrate that our system is feasible to implement and tolerates the human error factor while it is still able to achieve a constant spacing policy. Coordinated platoons of bicycles can be extremely useful to maximize the positive impact of green waves of traffic lights for cyclists and can be extended to groups of two-wheeled vehicles, including mopeds and self-balanced electric vehicles.},

In a user study (N=18), participants confirmed notifications in Augmented Reality (AR) using the three interaction modalities in a simulated biking scenario. We assessed the efficiency regarding reaction times, error rates, and perceived task load. Our results show significantly faster response times for MAGIC Pointing compared to Dwell Time and Gestures, while Dwell Time led to a significantly lower error rate compared to Gestures. Participants favored the MAGIC Pointing approach, supporting cyclists in AR selection tasks.

According to accident reports, one of the most dangerous situations for cyclists are uncontrolled intersections, where cars approach from both directions. To address this issue and assist cyclists in crossing decision-making at uncontrolled intersections, we designed two visualizations that: (1) highlight occluded cars through an X-ray vision and (2) depict the remaining time the intersection is safe to cross via a Countdown. To investigate the efficiency of these visualizations, we proposed an Augmented Reality simulation as a novel evaluation method, in which the above visualizations are represented as AR, and conducted a controlled experiment with 24 participants indoors. We found that the X-ray ensures a fast selection of shorter gaps between cars, while the Countdown facilitates a feeling of safety and provides a better intersection overview.},

	abstract = {Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA) is an emerging smart transportation technology that guides drivers through signalized intersections during green light phases, showing promise in mobile source pollution control. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding its impact on driving behavior, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. In this study, we used heavy-duty diesel truck (HDDT) as an example and conducted a comprehensive path study from the changes in driving behavior to fuel consumption and CO2 emission reduction after the application of GLOSA, using a portable emission measurement system for real-world driving tests at two research scales: signal-controlled road section and signalized intersections. The study was innovatively conducted in three scenarios: Without GLOSA, With GLOSA, and GW GLOSA, which considers the simultaneous application of Green Wave (GW) traffic control system. Results show that applying GLOSA, the passing rate of vehicles at signalized intersections significantly improves, the driving cycle curve tends to be smoother, the cruise time ratio increases to 67.60\%, and the travel time is reduced by 5\%–13\%. HDDT's average speed on the road segments (Seg) decreases by 25.15\%, and the aggressive acceleration and deceleration behavior near signalized intersections are significantly reduced. The trip fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of HDDT decrease by 16.63\%–23.51\% and 16.06\%–24.12\%, respectively. These fuel savings and CO2 emission reductions mainly occur in the Seg and Signalized intersection-after sections. After the simultaneous application of GLOSA and GW, the trip average speed increases by 60.90\%, and traffic efficiency is greatly improved. Although the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are slightly higher compared to GLOSA alone due to the higher driving speed, GW GLOSA still offers relatively considerable fuel and environmental benefits. This study deepens people's understanding of GLOSA and GW and provides support for the formulation of transportation efficiency improvement and environmental protection strategies.},

	abstract = {A discrete-time stochastic optimal control problem was recently proposed to address the GLOSA (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) problem in cases where the next signal switching time is decided in real time and is therefore uncertain in advance. The corresponding numerical solution via SDP (Stochastic Dynamic Programming) calls for substantial computation time, which excludes problem solution in the vehicle’s on-board computer in real time. In this context, the present paper concentrates on the challenge of developing numerical algorithms to solve efficiently the stochastic GLOSA problem. As a first attempt to overcome the computation time bottleneck, a modified version of Dynamic Programming, known as Discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDDP) was recently employed for the numerical solution of the stochastic optimal control problem and was demonstrated to achieve results equivalent to those obtained with the ordinary SDP algorithm, albeit with significantly reduced computation times. After an outline of the DDDP approach, the present work considers a second modified version of Dynamic Programming, known as Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). For the stochastic GLOSA problem, it is demonstrated that DDP achieves quasi-instantaneous (extremely fast) solutions in terms of CPU times, which allows for the proposed approach to be readily executable online, in an MPC (Model Predictive Control) framework, in the vehicle’s on-board computer. The novel numerical approach is tested and demonstrated by use of realistic examples and is compared to the SDP and DDDP solutions. It should be noted that DDP does not require discretization of variables, hence the obtained solutions may be slightly superior to the standard SDP solutions.},

We apply a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based method for matching cycling tracks to a “bicycle network” extracted from crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and evaluate its effective differences in terms of optimal routing compared with a simple geometric point-to-curve method. OSM has quickly established itself as a popular resource for bicycle routing; however, its high-level of detail presents challenges for its applicability to popularity-based routing. We propose a solution where bikeways are prioritized in map-matching, achieving good performance; the HMM-based method matched correctly on average 94\% of the route length. In addition, we show that the extremely biased nature of the trajectory dataset, which is typical of volunteered user-generated data, can be of high importance in terms of popularity-based routing. Most computed routes diverged depending on whether the number of users or number of tracks was used as an indicator of popularity, which may imply varying preferences among different types of cyclists. Revising the number of tracks by diversity of users to surmount local biases in the data had a more limited effect on routing.},

	abstract = {The neglect of non-motorized transportation options in transport planning and demand modelling is gradually being addressed in the United Kingdom. In route choice research there has been, in recent years, a trend away from modelling hypothetical situations towards field testing. This is partly due to the effective use of emerging GPS technologies for gathering travel behavior data in “wild” urban spaces, making it possible to observe realistic situations. Such data on detailed travel behaviors offer possibilities for further research, especially in the non-motorized transportation arena. Globally, there has been progress in the development of cyclists’ route choice models using revealed preference GPS data from various geographical and local contexts. However, we have little evidence on detailed cyclists’ route choices in the UK in a national and local context. This is particularly the case with low cycling participation cities in North England, where there have been various attempts to increase cycling uptake in recent years. This chapter fills this knowledge gap by undertaking a route choice analysis using the cycling-friendly version of OpenStreetMap (OSM) as the transportation network for analysis, alongside GPS tracks (7 days) and travel diary data for 79 Utility Cyclists around Newcastle upon Tyne in North East England. We examined specific variables as proposed in the relevant cycling literature and used these to develop a model testing the null hypothesis that network restrictions (i.e. one way, turn restrictions and access) do not have any significant influence on the movement of commuter cyclists. The findings suggest that OSM can provide a robust transportation network for cycling research, in particular when combined with GPS track data. The observed routes were significantly longer than their shortest path alternatives, the only exception being the straight-line distance between the observed bike routes and the unrestricted network routes, where the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that network restrictions for both observed and shortest paths are significant, suggesting that route directness is an important factor to be considered for restricted and unrestricted networks.},

Video and radar-based traffic counting are used as supplementary methods to affirm bicycle volume changes in the broader population. The bicycle lane intervention resulted in a shift in the preferred route in the neighbourhood. The intervention street saw increased numbers of bicycle trips taken whilst the two nearest parallel routes in the same neighbourhood witnessed a decrease. For bicycle trips taken on the intervention street, the mean deviation from the shortest path increased (from 171 to 221m, p{\textless} .05). Bicycle counts based on video observations also support the route shift finding. Bicycle modal share did not significantly increase when comparing the panel sub-group exposed to the intervention (n=39) with a quasi-control group (n=47) who were not exposed but had made at least one trip in the near vicinity of the intervention in both time periods. This natural experiment study provides evidence to suggest that route substitution from nearby streets and paths can explain more of the change in bicycling levels than modal shifts to bicycling in the short term following the opening of the bike lane.},

The provision of adequate bicycling infrastructure is considered as one of the most efficient means to increase cycling safety. However, limited public funding does not always allow agencies to implement cycling infrastructure improvements at the desirable level. Thus, bicycle trip planners can at least partly alleviate the lack of adequate infrastructure by recommending optimal routes in terms of safety. The presented study provides a systematic review of 35 bicycle routing applications and analyses to which degree they promote safe bicycling. The results show that most trip planners lack corresponding routing options and therefore do not sufficiently address safety concerns of bicyclists. Based on these findings, we developed recommendations on how to better address bicycling safety in routing portals. We suggest employing current communication technology and analysis to consider safety concerns more explicitly.},

Its development requires the investigation of road usage and interactions between traffic commuters. This article is focused on exploiting crowdsourced user-generated data, namely GPS trajectories collected by cyclists and road network infrastructure generated by citizens, to extract and analyze spatial patterns and road-type use of cyclists in urban environments. Since user-generated data shows data-deficiencies, we introduce tailored spatial data-handling processes for which several algorithms are developed and implemented. These include data filtering and segmentation, map-matching and spatial arrangement of GPS trajectories with the road network. A spatial analysis and a characterization of road-type use are then carried out to investigate and identify specific spatial patterns of cycle routes. The proposed analysis was applied to the cities of Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Osnabrück (Germany), proving its feasibility and reliability in mining road-type use and extracting pattern information and preferences. This information can help users who wish to explore friendlier and more interesting cycle patterns, based on collective usage, as well as city planners and transportation experts wishing to pinpoint areas most in need of further development and planning.},

Model estimation is performed for different route choice sets to test the sensitivity of the parameter estimates.

In this paper, we address this gap and provide a multi-criteria formulation of the bicycle routing problem and an optimum multi-label correcting algorithm for finding a full set of Pareto routes. To reduce the potentially very large number of Pareto solutions, we introduce a route selection algorithm, based on hierarchical clustering, for extracting a small representative subset of Pareto routes. We empirically evaluate our approach on a real-world cycleway network. We explore the size and structure of the set of Pareto routes and demonstrate the capability of our method to generate a practical set of bicycle routes in realistic conditions.},

	abstract = {Researchers have shown that GPS units in smartphones can be used to identify routes taken by cyclists, including whether cyclists deviate from shortest paths to use bike lanes and other facilities. Researchers previously have not reported whether GPS tracking can be used to monitor whether and how bicyclists actually use lanes on streets, where these lanes have been provided, or other types of facilities. The objective of this research was to determine whether smartphone GPS units or enhanced GPS units could be used to track and map the location of cyclists on streets. The research team modified an open-source smartphone application (CycleTracks) to integrate with a higher-quality external GPS unit. Cyclists then mounted the smartphone with route-tracking applications to bicycles and repeatedly rode four different routes. The routes for the field tests were chosen because each included a striped lane for bicycle traffic and because the routes bisected a variety of built urban environments, ranging from an open location on a bridge over the Mississippi River to a narrow urban street lined by tall, multi-story office buildings. The field tests demonstrated that neither the smartphone GPS units nor the higher-quality external GPS receiver generate data accurate enough to monitor bicyclists’ use of bike lanes or other facilities. This lack of accuracy means that researchers interested in obtaining data about the propensity of cyclists to ride in lanes, when available, must rely on other technologies to obtain data for analyses.},

This is a continuation of previous work were we concluded that RTK-SN alone is not sufficient in moderately dense urban areas as buildings and other obstructions degrade the performance of RTK-SN significantly. In this work we have added odometry to the positioning system as well as extending RTK-SN with multiple satellite constellations to deal with situations where the view of the sky is poor and thus fewer satellites are in view. To verify the performance of the positioning system we have used Ultra-Wideband radios as an independent positioning system to compare against while testing during poor conditions for RTK-SN. We were able to verify that adding dead reckoning and multiple satellite constellations improves the performance significantly under poor conditions and makes the positioning system more useful for active safety systems.},

This chapter proposes a four-step geographic data-conflation system: preprocessing, automatic conflation, evaluation, and manual adjustments. The automatic-conflation component uses an optimization approach to find matched features and a rubber-sheeting approach to complete spatial transformation. This system was tested using two bikeway datasets in Los Angeles County, California, from an authoritative source (Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and an open source (OpenStreetMap). While bikeways that are already in both datasets are improved in terms of positional accuracy and attribute completeness, the conflated bikeway dataset also integrates complementary data in either of the input datasets. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of using crowd-sourced data to improve official bikeway data, which is important for building and maintaining high-quality bicycle-infrastructure datasets. The framework described in this chapter can be adapted to conflate other types of data themes.},

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative global map that was built by volunteers and is promising for active transportation research. In this article, we use OSM to inventory bicycling infrastructure in six Canadian cities, compare it to municipal open data, and provide guidance for practitioners using OSM data. We conducted an evaluation of OSM and open data, overall and for four categories of bicycle infrastructure: cycle tracks; on-street bicycle lanes; paths (bicycle only or multiuse); and local street bikeways. We found that the concordance in terms of total length of OSM infrastructure to open data infrastructure very high in two of the six cities ({\textless} ±2\%), and reasonably high in all cities (maximum difference ±30\%). Concordance for infrastructure categories was highest for on-street bicycle lanes, which were the most common, and easily identifiable type of bicycle infrastructure in the OSM data, and lowest for cycle tracks and local street bikeways, both of which are new or relatively rare infrastructure types in some Canadian cities. In some cases, OSM was more detailed and timely than open data. A challenge in OSM is consistent tagging of bicycle infrastructure types. We encourage practitioners to consider OSM data for multicity studies, but to be mindful of potential inconsistencies in attribution and local definitions. We also recommend users of OSM to publish data queries for repeatability.},

One of the unique characteristics of OSM has been the availability of the full history of users’ contributions, which can leverage our quality control mechanisms through exploiting the history of contributions. Since this aspect of contributions (i.e., historical contributions) has been neglected in the literature, this study aims at presenting a novel approach for improving the positional accuracy and completeness of the OSM road network. To do so, we present a five-stage approach based on a Voronoi diagram that leads to improving the positional accuracy and completeness of the OSM road network. In the first stage, the OSM data history file is retrieved and in the second stage, the corresponding data elements for each object in the historical versions are identified. In the third stage, data cleaning on the historical datasets is carried out in order to identify outliers and remove them accordingly. In the fourth stage, through applying the Voronoi diagram method, one representative version for each set of historical versions is extracted. In the final stage, through examining the spatial relations for each object in the history file, the topology of the target object is enhanced. As per validation, a comparison between the latest version of the OSM data and the result of our approach against a reference dataset is carried out. Given a case study in Tehran, our findings reveal that the completeness and positional precision of OSM features can be improved up to 14\%. Our conclusions draw attention to the exploitation of the historical archive of the contributions in OSM as an intrinsic quality indicator.},

	abstract = {One of the most significant challenges in cities concerns urban mobility. Urban mobility involves the use of different modes of transport, which can be individual or collective, and different organizations can produce their respective datasets that, usually, are used isolated from each other. The lack of an integrated view of the entire multimodal urban transportation network (MUTN) brings difficulties to citizens and urban planning. However, obtaining reliable and up-to-date spatial data is not an easy task. To address this problem, we propose a framework for creating a multimodal urban transportation network by integrating spatial data from heterogeneous sources. The framework standardizes the representation of different datasets through a common conceptual model for spatial data (schema matching), uses topological, geometric, and semantic information to find matches among objects from different datasets (data matching), and consolidated them into a single representation using data fusion techniques in a complementary, redundant and cooperative way. Spatial data integration makes it possible to use reliable data from official sources (possibly outdated and expensive to produce) and crowdsourced data (continuously updated and low cost to use). To evaluate the framework, a MUTN for the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte was built integrating authoritative and crowdsourced data (OpenStreetMap, Foursquare, Facebook Places, Google Places, and Yelp), and then it was used to compute routes among eighty locations using four transportation possibilities: walk, drive, transit, and drive–walk. The time and distance of each route were compared against their equivalent from Google Maps, and the results point to a great potential for using the framework in urban computing applications that require an integrated view of the entire multimodal urban transportation network.},

But recently, Web 2.0 technologies and the wide dissemination of GPS-enabled devices boosted public participation in collaborative mapping projects (CMPs). In this regard, the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project has been one of the most successful representatives, providing LU features. The main objective of this paper is to comparatively assess the accuracy of the contributed OSM-LU features in four German metropolitan areas versus the pan-European GMESUA dataset as a reference. Kappa index analysis along with per-class user’s and producers’ accuracies are used for accuracy assessment. The empirical findings suggest OSM as an alternative complementary source for extracting LU information whereas exceeding 50 \% of the selected cities are mapped by mappers. Moreover, the results identify which land types preserve high/moderate/low accuracy across cities for urban LU mapping. The findings strength the potential of collaboratively collected LU features for providing temporal LU maps as well as updating/enriching existing inventories. Furthermore, such a collaborative approach can be used for collecting a global coverage of LU information specifically in countries in which temporal and monetary efforts could be minimized.},

	abstract = {Perception of safety varies among cyclists depending on their cycling experience and frequency as well as on their socio-demographic attributes, particularly age and gender. Female cyclists are often more likely to feel unsafe than their male counterparts under similar traffic conditions or surrounding environment. In general, female cyclists are known to avoid slopes and high traffic, and prefer shorter trips than their male counterparts. However, there is no research that has yet explicitly modeled the differences in route choice between female and male cyclists using revealed preference data. In this research, we use GPS enabled smartphone based route data to develop segmented route choice models for different age groups and genders. The results indicate that segmented models are significantly better representatives of route choices made by female and male cyclists than pooled models. The findings suggest that traffic characteristics such as speed and annual average daily traffic (AADT) influence the decision to choose a particular route differently for female cyclists and male cyclists. Similar results are seen across different age groups as well. Preference towards routes with cycling facilities are however universal and no significant difference is noted among gender or age segments in this regard.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the number of electric bicycles on European, American and especially Chinese roads has increased substantially. Today, 11\% of all bicycles sold in Germany are e-bikes. Given their potential to reach higher maximum speeds, concerns have been raised about a possible increase in crash risk associated with e-bike use. However, as of now, it is unclear if and how often the potentially higher speed is actually reached in everyday cycling. As part of the German Naturalistic Cycling Study we measured and compared the speed of three bicycle types (conventional bicycles, pedelecs (pedalling supported up to 25km/h), S-pedelecs (pedalling supported up to 45km/h)) under naturalistic conditions. Ninety participants, divided in three age groups, took part in our study. Participants used their own bikes or e-bikes. The bicycles were equipped with a data acquisition system, which included sensors to record speed and distance, as well as two cameras. Data was collected over a period of four weeks for each participant. Nearly 17,000km of cycling were recorded in total. The statistical analysis revealed significant differences in mean speed between all three bicycle types. Pedelec riders were, on average, 2km/h faster than cyclists. S-pedelec speed was even 9km/h higher. A similar pattern was also found when analysing free flow conditions and uphill or downhill cycling separately. The highest speed was measured on carriageways and bicycle infrastructure, regardless of bicycle type. Participants aged over 65years rode significantly slower than younger participants. Data on acceleration from standstill largely confirm the differences between bicycle types and age groups. The results show that electric bicycles indeed reach higher speeds than conventional bicycles regularly. Although it is unclear if this also leads to an increase in crash risk, it can be assumed that the consequences of a crash might be, on average, more severe.},

Roger Geller, bicycle coordinator for the City of Portland, Oregon, proposed a typology that characterized people as one of four types—strong and fearless, enthused and confident, interested but concerned, and no way, no how—with respect to their attitudes toward bicycling. The research presented here sought to find out how applicable the typology was nationally and explored motivating factors, barriers, and the appeal of various bicycle facility types for each type of cyclist or potential cyclist. This study followed up on an earlier study that tested Geller’s typology with Portland data. In this new study, a sample involved 3,000 adults who lived in the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. On the basis of respondents’ (a) stated level of comfort when they bicycled in different environments, (b) their interest in bicycling, and (c) their recent behavior, the study estimated that about one-third of adults were in the no way, no how group, and about half were in the interested but concerned group. The distribution was similar to that of the earlier findings for Portland. Several demographic differences emerged, with women less likely to be enthusiastic and confident or to be interested but concerned. Few differences appeared in whether respondents had ridden a bike at all in the past 30 days. Differences emerged as to where they bicycled and how often. The interested but concerned group was least likely to ride for transportation and rode less frequently. Barriers included not having a bicycle to ride; needing a vehicle for work, school, or other reasons; destinations too far to reach by bicycle; too few bike lanes or trails; and traffic.},

Transit service is a realistic option only if the service is available at or near locations when a person plans to travel. Whereas various measures exist for transit availability such as service frequency, the focus of this study was on the spatial aspect of pedestrian accessibility to transit stations, that is, on service coverage. Service areas are commonly used to visualize accessibility for pedestrians to transit systems and to analyze the potential ridership. Because the service area for a station is defined over the maximum network walking distance from a transit station, a complete street network that includes pedestrian segments, that is, shortcuts, is highly important for a realistic assessment of service areas. Whereas most proprietary geodata providers concentrate solely on car-related geodata, public domain street data and volunteered geographic information, such as OpenStreetMap, provide a potential valuable source for pedestrian data. The authors compared the amount of pedestrian-related data between freely available sources (OpenStreetMap or TIGER or both) and proprietary providers (Tele Atlas or NAVTEQ or both). The effect on modeling transit accessibility for pedestrians was analyzed for five U.S. and four German cities, and differences between these two countries were identified.},

	abstract = {Matching road networks is an essential step for data enrichment and data quality assessment, among other processes. Conventionally, road networks from two datasets are matched using a line-based approach that checks for the similarity of properties of line segments. In this article, a polygon-based approach is proposed to match the OpenStreetMap road network with authority data. The algorithm first extracts urban blocks that are central elements of urban planning and are represented by polygons surrounded by their surrounding streets, and it then assigns road lines to edges of urban blocks by checking their topologies. In the matching process, polygons of urban blocks are matched in the first step by checking for overlapping areas. In the second step, edges of a matched urban block pair are further matched with each other. Road lines that are assigned to the same matched pair of urban block edges are then matched with each other. The computational cost is substantially reduced because the proposed approach matches polygons instead of road lines, and thus, the process of matching is accelerated. Experiments on Heidelberg and Shanghai datasets show that the proposed approach achieves good and robust matching results, with a precision higher than 96\% and a F1-score better than 90\%.},

	abstract = {The problem of eco-driving is analyzed for an urban traffic network in presence of signalized intersections. It is assumed that the traffic light timings are known and available to the vehicles via infrastructure-to-vehicle communication. This work provides a solution to the energy consumption minimization while traveling through a sequence of signalized intersections and always catching a green light. The optimal- control problem is non-convex because of the constraints coming from the traffic lights; therefore, a sub-optimal strategy to restore the convexity and solve the problem is proposed. Firstly, a pruning algorithm aims at reducing the optimization domain by considering only the portions of the traffic light's green phases that allow to drive in compliance with the city speed limits. Then, a graph is created in the feasible region in order to approximate the energy consumption associated with each available path in the driving horizon. Lastly, after the problem convexity is recovered, a simple optimization problem is solved on the selected path to calculate the optimal crossing times at each intersection. The optimal speeds are then suggested to the driver. The proposed sub-optimal strategy is compared with the optimal solution provided by dynamic programming for validation purposes. It is also shown that the low computational load of the presented approach enables robustness properties and results very appealing for online use. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system is a Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) that is supposed to reduce the energy consumption and travel time associated with a vehicle trip by providing an optimal speed profile to avoid unnecessary stops at an intersection, based on Traffic Light Signals (TLSs) information. It is expected that GLOSA solutions will be widely deployed on transportation networks, thanks to the rapid spread of increasingly effective and pervasive communication technologies. Thus, appropriate methodologies and tools should be adopted to test sustainability objectives and evaluate the effects of such systems on the performance of traffic networks. In this perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced testing approach of GLOSA services based on an Integrated Simulation Environment that combines custom models developed in Matlab/Simulink with the SUMO traffic simulation environment, allowing both the traffic environment and vehicle dynamics to be represented with a suitable level of detail. The proposed approach can be used to cover several aspects which, in the existing technical literature, are: (i) not considered (traffic signal phase condition); (ii) rarely considered (electric engine); (iii) considered in a non-integrated way (traffic condition, TLS cycle duration, communication distance and minimum speed). Indeed, the considered factors pertain to different subsystems of the mobility environment (network and vehicles), and the proposed testing framework allows an equally detailed simulation of all, thus enhancing the accuracy of the results. To show the validity of the proposed approach, this study considers one controlled vehicle, equipped with a GLOSA system, travelling along a single route through a city centre including many TLSs. The simulation analysis deals with different levels of considered factors, assessed through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to mobility and environmental indicators. Numerical results confirm that the proposed Integrated Simulation Environment can give valuable insights and suggestions to design a GLOSA system aiming to enhance both mobility and environmental performance. They also show that the factors in question affect system performance differently.},

	abstract = {Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems have emerged to allow drivers to pass traffic lights during a green interval. However, various adaptive and intelligent traffic light control approaches have been adopted in many cities, resulting in the development of current GLOSA technologies lagging behind that of traffic light technologies. When taking diverse dynamic traffic lights into account, it is difficult to model the interactions between vehicles and traffic lights, which is further exacerbated by the hybrid control strategies of traffic lights. To this end, we design a new GLOSA system SpeedAdv to provide optimal speed advisory for addressing diverse traffic lights. We formulate the problem as a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process (MAMDP) with an implicit common goal and propose a heterogeneous-agent collaborative framework based on reinforcement learning. Three main modules are used in the system: i) a spatio-temporal relation reasoning module based on the phase-aware attention mechanism pays more attention to the traffic rules and traffic flow diversion of adjacent intersections to predict traffic conditions for a few seconds later; ii) a behavior approximating module based on imitation learning is introduced to approximate the phases of diverse traffic lights; iii) a speed advisory module provides the optimal speed advisory based on policy gradient reinforcement learning relying on the above two modules and other information collected by vehicles. We implement and evaluate SpeedAdv with a real-world trajectory dataset, together with a field test based on a prototype system, demonstrating that SpeedAdv improves the overall performance by at least 24.1\% in terms of travel time, energy consumption, safety and comfort compared to the state-of-the-art GreenDrive method.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and evaluation of GreenDrive, a smartphone-based system that helps drivers save fuel by judiciously advising on driving speed to match the signal phase and timing (SPAT) of upcoming signalized traffic intersections. In the absence of such advice, the default driver behavior is usually to accelerate to (near) the maximum legally allowable speed, traffic conditions permitting. This behavior is suboptimal if the traffic light ahead will turn red just before the vehicle arrives at the intersection. GreenDrive uses collected real-time vehicle mobility data to predict exact signal timing a few tens of seconds ahead, which allows it to offer advice on speed that saves fuel by avoiding unnecessary acceleration that leads to arriving too soon and stopping at red lights. Our work differs from previous work in three respects. First and most importantly, we tackle the more challenging scenario, where some phases (such as left-turn arrows) are added or skipped dynamically, in accordance with real-time traffic demand. Second, our approach can accommodate a low system penetration rate and low vehicle density. Third, GreenDrive treats user-specified travel time requirements as soft deadlines and chooses appropriate speed adaptation strategies according to the user time budget. Using SUMO traffic simulator with real and large-scale road network, we show that GreenDrive learns phase durations with an average error below 2s, and reduces fuel consumption by up to 23.9\%. Real-world experiments confirm 31.2\% fuel saving and the ability to meet end-to-end travel time requirements.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, metropolitan areas are prioritizing growth in the share of trips taken by bicycle to improve health outcomes, transportation affordability, and environmental performance of the transport system. Evidence is building that network quality is an important determinant in bicycle commuting and route choice. One prominent metric of facility attractiveness is bicycle level of traffic stress (LTS). In tandem, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is becoming an important source of network data for routing and for generating measures of multimodal accessibility. Although there are studies that examine the completeness of OSM tags and utilize OSM data to compute LTS on networks, none of them examine the accuracy of these analyses. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of OSM-derived LTS predictions and offer quality assurance strategies to reduce inaccurate predictions. This study compares OSM-derived LTS predictions with ground-truthed LTS scores created by Montgomery County. It finds that OSM-derived LTS networks provide comparable results to the ground-truthed data. The OSM-derived LTS scores correctly identified 89.9\% of the length of the network as either high (LTS 3 or 4) or low stress (LTS 1 or 2). However, this study demonstrates there is a higher potential for error within certain street typologies and urban contexts, and that low-stress accessibility calculations can be very sensitive to even a small number of incorrectly classified segments. Finally, practices to improve the quality of OSM-derived LTS predictions and low-stress accessibility calculations are suggested.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications, the most striking example of a geographical application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed ‘Volunteered Geographical Information’ (VGI) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80\% overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29\% of the area of England, of which approximately 24\% are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings to the study of VGI as well as suggesting future research directions.},

	abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an extraordinarily large and diverse spatial database of the world. Road networks are amongst the most frequently occurring spatial content within the OSM database. These road network representations are usable in many applications. However the quality of these representations can vary between locations. Comparing OSM road networks with authoritative road datasets for a given area or region is an important task in assessing OSM's fitness for use for applications like routing and navigation. Such comparisons can be technically challenging and no software implementation exists which facilitates them easily and automatically. In this article we develop and propose a flexible methodology for comparing the geometry of OSM road network data with other road datasets. Quantitative measures for the completeness and spatial accuracy of OSM are computed, including the compatibility of OSM road data with other map databases. Our methodology provides users with significant flexibility in how they can adjust the parameterization to suit their needs. This software implementation is exclusively built on open source software and a significant degree of automation is provided for these comparisons. This software can subsequently be extended and adapted for comparison between OSM and other external road datasets.},

This study aimed to develop multimodal transport networks using a graph database that can accommodate efficient updates and extensions, high relation-based query performance, and flexible integration in multimodal routing. As a case study, a database was constructed for London transport networks, and routing tests were performed under various conditions. The constructed multimodal graph database showed stable performance in processing iterative queries, and efficient multi-stop routing was particularly enhanced. By applying the proposed framework, databases for multimodal routing can be readily constructed for other regions, while enabling responses to diversified routings, such as personalized routing through integration with various unstructured information, due to the flexible schema of the graph database.},

	abstract = {Information on bicycle route choice is crucial for bicycle infrastructure planning. Emerging techniques of crowd-sourcing (e.g. FietsTelweek or CITY CYCLING) help to bridge the data gap. The collected data often illustratates the spatial distribution of bicycle traffic within cities and, thus, can help to monitore traffic. However, it is not suitable to forecast changes in traffic flows resulting from infrastructural measures. Traffic demand models are proper tools for that purpose but the utilization requires modelling and data expertise. Furthermore, most models are not based on observed route choice behavior. The contribution presents results of the "bikeSim" project, which intends to tackle that challenge. First aim of the study was to analyze bicycle route choice based on a) revealed preference GPS route data and b) open transport supply data. Second, a new simulation platform called "bikeSim" was implemented to provide an accessible and easy-to-use tool for bicycle traffic simulation. The contribution presents the results of the study, which initially focused on the city of Dresden (Germany). It reveals that bicycle route choice in Dresden depends on different factors such as slope, type of bicycle infrastructure, surface and its quality as well as speed of motorized traffic. The multinomial logit model (MNL) realistically reproduces bicycle route choice decisions (accuracy of 88.6\%). The implementation of the model into the bikeSim web-app enables planners to simulate changes in bicycle traffic resulting from changes in infrastructure (e.g. type of bike infrastructure) or on operational level (e.g. speed of motorized traffic). Thus, the route choice model and the webapp can significantly support decision-making in the planning process.},

The purpose of these devices is to assist motorists in decision-making at signalized intersections with real-time signal duration information. This study focused specifically on driver responses in the presence of a Red Signal Countdown Timer (RSCT). A Linear Mixed Effect (LME) model was developed to predict the effect of RSCT on the headway of the first vehicle waiting on a red signal. The model predicted 0.72s reduction in the headway of the first queued vehicle resulting from the presence of RSCT, while the observed difference in mean headway was 0.82s. This result is suggestive of a reduction in start-up lost time at signalized intersections, i.e., an improvement in signalized intersection efficiency when an RSCT is present.},

However, bicycle networks are typically developed in a slow, piecewise process that leaves open a large number of gaps, even in well-developed cycling cities like Copenhagen. Here, we develop the IPDC procedure (Identify, Prioritize, Decluster, Classify) for finding the most important missing links in urban bicycle networks, using data from OpenStreetMap. In this procedure we first identify all possible gaps following a multiplex network approach, prioritize them according to a flow-based metric, decluster emerging gap clusters, and manually classify the types of gaps. We apply the IPDC procedure to Copenhagen and report the 105 top priority gaps. For evaluation, we compare these gaps with the city’s most recent Cycle Path Prioritization Plan and find considerable overlaps. Our results show how network analysis with minimal data requirements can serve as a cost-efficient support tool for bicycle network planning. By taking into account the whole city network for consolidating urban bicycle infrastructure, our data-driven framework can complement localized, manual planning processes for more effective, city-wide decision-making.},

	abstract = {“Smart” vehicles of the future are envisioned to aid their drivers in reducing fuel consumption and emissions by wirelessly receiving phase-shifting information of the traffic lights in their vicinity and computing an optimized speed in order to avoid braking and acceleration maneuvers. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential environmental benefit in small-scale simulation scenarios. To assess the overall benefit, large-scale simulations are required. In order to ensure computational feasibility, the applied simulation models need to be simplified as far as possible without sacrificing credibility. Therefore this work presents the results of a sensitivity analysis and identifies gear choice and the distance from the traffic light at which vehicles are informed as key influencing factors. Our results indicate that a suboptimal gear choice can void the benefits of the speed adaptation. Furthermore, we present first results of a scale-up simulation using a real-world inner-city road network and discuss the range in which we expect the saving in fuel consumption to be in reality.},

	doi = {10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083073},
	abstract = {In recent years there has been significant interest in intelligent transportation technology that has specific energy and environmental benefits. Among these, dynamic eco-driving techniques on signalized corridors are being developed and employed with energy and environmental benefits (e.g., lower fuel consumption and emissions) in the general range of 5\% to 20\% for the individual vehicles that have the technology (the vehicles that are able to plan their velocity trajectories before they approaching an intersection, basing on the signal phase and timing (SPAT) information through dedicated short-range communication (DSRC)). The topic of this paper addresses the question on whether there are any additional network-wide energy/emissions benefits for the overall traffic from initial low-penetration rates of the technology. To this end, we have carried out a research study consisting of an extensive set of traffic simulations for an arterial corridor with different levels of congestion and different penetration rates of dynamic eco-driving technology. It is found that there are indeed indirect network-wide energy and emissions benefits for the overall traffic, even at low penetration rates of the dynamic eco-driving technology-equipped vehicles. In the experiments, the maximum fuel saving and emission reduction occurs during medium congestion (corresponding to traffic volume of 300 vehicles/lane/hour) and with low penetration rates (5\%, 10\% and 20\%). Under these conditions, the total traffic energy/emissions typically triple what is saved from the technology-equipped vehicles alone (e.g., total 4\% savings compared to 1.3\% savings).},

	abstract = {This brief deals with the improvement of a vehicle's pass-through of predictively known urban driving situations concerning its fuel consumption. Today's technology enables the prediction of information about traffic events. This information can be used to identify efficient driving strategies. The main aim is to reduce the dynamics in the velocity profiles of driving situations and with it the corresponding fuel consumption in urban traffic. An algorithm has been built to calculate fuel consumption optimized driving trajectories. Input parameters are temporal and spatial depending constraints of the driving situation as well as other restrictions like a speed-limit. The main objective of the function was to enable a situation adaptive reaction to every predictively known forthcoming traffic event. Thus an optimized driving trajectory can be steadily calculated for the next route section of the vehicle provided that predictive information about the traffic events are available. The higher the availability of information the better an optimization of the driving strategies will be possible. Fuel characteristics and other energetically relevant data for a real-world vehicle have been created by detailed simulation to evaluate the fuel consumption of the driving strategies. For demonstration purposes the common driving situation ”traffic light” was chosen. The fuel consumption calculated for the predictive driving strategies is compared to the consumption of a simulated average driver without predictive information. The calculated potentials have been verified by measuring the fuel consumption of an experimental vehicle for the simulated driving strategies.},

	abstract = {While traffic signals are necessary to safely control competing flows of traffic, they inevitably enforce a stop-and-go movement pattern that increases fuel consumption, reduces traffic flow and causes traffic jams. These side effects can be alleviated by providing drivers and their onboard computational devices (e.g., vehicle computer, smartphone) with information about the schedule of the traffic signals ahead. Based on when the signal ahead will turn green, drivers can then adjust speed so as to avoid coming to a complete halt. Such information is called Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA). Alternatively, the onboard computational device may suggest an efficient detour that will save the driver from stops and long waits at red lights ahead. This paper introduces and evaluates SignalGuru, a novel software service that relies solely on a collection of mobile phones to detect and predict the traffic signal schedule, enabling GLOSA and other novel applications. Our SignalGuru leverages windshield-mounted phones to opportunistically detect current traffic signals with their cameras, collaboratively communicate and learn traffic signal schedule patterns, and predict their future schedule. Results from two deployments of SignalGuru, using iPhones in cars in Cambridge (MA, USA) and Singapore, show that traffic signal schedules can be predicted accurately. On average, SignalGuru comes within 0.66s, for pre-timed traffic signals and within 2.45s, for traffic-adaptive traffic signals. Feeding SignalGuru's predicted traffic schedule to our GLOSA application, our vehicle fuel consumption measurements show savings of 20.3\%, on average.},

Availability of signal phase data is categorized into none, real-time only, and full-future knowledge. Dynamic Programming (DP) with full future knowledge of SPAT provides an energy efficiency maximum. The case with no knowledge of phase or timing represents an uninformed driver, and provides an energy efficiency minimum. In between, a signal phase prediction model which could use historically-averaged timing data and real-time phase data is evaluated, as it represents a technology which is available today.

To reduce vehicles' CO2 emissions, vehicles' travel should be smoothed by reducing the stop-and-go times. In this paper, a three-tier structure is proposed to realize dynamic traffic light control for smoothing vehicles' travel. In tier-1, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system is employed for collecting road traffic flow data and calculating the recommended speed. In tier-2, radio antennas are installed near the traffic lights. Road traffic flow information can be obtained by wireless communication between the antennas and ETC devices. In tier-3, a branch-and-bound-based real-time traffic light control algorithm is designed to smooth vehicles' travels. After smoothing vehicles' travels, more vehicles can pass intersections with less waiting time and fewer short-time stops; therefore, the vehicles' CO2 emissions can be reduced. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme performs much better than the adaptive fuzzy traffic light control method: The average waiting time, short-time stop times, and CO2 emissions are greatly reduced, and the nonstop passing rate is greatly improved.},

An eco-approach application uses Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) and intersection map information of signalized intersections to provide drivers with recommendations in order to encourage “green” driving while approaching, passing through, and departing the intersections. Upon receiving SPaT information, invehicle systems calculate and provide speed advice to the driver, allowing the driver to adapt the vehicle's speed to pass through the upcoming signal on green or to decelerate to a stop in the most eco-friendly manner. Eco-approach methods have been proposed and simulated showing promising results. In this study, both simulation experimentation and field operational testing have been carried out to demonstrate the eco-approach application and to quantify its potential fuel and carbon dioxide (CO2) savings. Furthermore, it has been shown that a communication platform based on a 4G/LTE network link and a cloud-based server infrastructure is effective and sufficient for this kind of application. It was found in both the simulation experiment and the field operational testing that on average 14\% fuel and CO2 savings can be achieved.},

	abstract = {The highest fuel consumption on urban arterials is associated with driving in congested traffic, characterized by higher speed fluctuations and frequent stops at intersections. One way to reduce excessive stop-and-go driving on urban streets is to optimize signal timings. More recently, new methods in traffic signal optimization have incorporated changes in drivers' behavior to achieve optimum performance at signalized intersections. Connected vehicles technology provides a two-way wireless communication environment enabling vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, which can be used for a variety of mobility and safety applications. One such application is called the green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA). This system uses timely and accurate information about traffic signal timing and traffic signal locations to guide drivers (through infrastructure-to-vehicle communication) with speed advice for a more uniform commute with less stopping time through traffic signals. A GLOSA implementation was evaluated for two types of traffic signal timing: predictable fixed-time signal timing and unpredictable actuated–coordinated signal timing. A two-intersection traffic network was modeled in VISSIM to achieve trustworthy results calibrated in the field. A comprehensive modal emission model was used to accurately estimate emissions. Experiments included various infrastructure-to-vehicle penetration rates and GLOSA activation frequencies. Results indicated that actuated–coordinated signal timings were not dependable for use in GLOSA systems. For fixed-time signals, higher penetration rates and more frequent GLOSA activations resulted in better traffic performance. GLOSA caused only minor improvements in fuel consumption, and average delay in vehicles stopped was improved significantly.},

Our algorithm exploits Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication (V2I) to extend the planning horizon and create sufficiently stable plans using dynamic programming.

Smart traffic lights are believed to contribute to achieving this by either adapting their signal program or by informing approaching drivers. In this paper we investigate the potentials and limitations of the latter, that is, Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems in a realistic, large scale simulation study. We examine the impact of different equipment rates of both traffic lights and vehicles on environmental related metrics but also study how these systems can increase the comfort for drivers by reducing waiting times and the number of stops. We find that at low traffic densities these systems can meet all their goals and lower CO2 emissions by up to 11.5\% whereas in dense traffic several side-effects could be observed, including overall longer waiting times and even higher CO2 emissions for unequipped vehicles.},

The existing GLOSA approaches are single segment, that is, they consider traffic lights independently by providing vehicles with the optimal speed for the segment ahead of the nearest traffic lights. In this article we introduce a new approach-a multi segment GLOSA-according to which several lights in sequence on a vehicle's route are taken into account. The speed optimisation process is performed using a genetic algorithm. We assume that a vehicle has access to all traffic light phase schedules that it will encounter on its route. The route is composed of segments divided by traffic lights. The proposed GLOSA provides a driver with speed advisory for each segment according to selected preferences like minimisation of total traveling time or fuel consumption.

This pre-series deployment comprises several hundreds of intersections in Verona, Berlin, and Garmisch-Partenkirchen. This implementation is the next step in a development line starting with R\&D projects involving traffic signal control such as travolution-ingolstadt.de [2] and finalizing in a potential series product service. Applying SAE J2735 [1] Signal Phase and Timing (SPAT) and Map Data (MAP) messages in a real operational environment proved the feasibility of the chosen processing architecture and revealed technical and operational challenges to be mastered. The paper also explains why in this pre-series deployment transition the service is using C-ITS technology, but not DSRC as carrier medium due to commercial and organizational constraints of the operational setting. Furthermore it depicts the requirements of the communication from the automotive view.},

In addition, continuing urbanization all around the world makes this problem more severe especially at urban intersections. In this paper, we present a new green light optimal speed advisory (GLOSA), called the driver-centric GLOSA (DC-GLOSA), which advises the degree of acceleration/braking by comparing the current vehicle mobility with several reference mobility models. We argue that the DC-GLOSA can achieve higher fuel efficiency, better driving comfort, and less driver's distraction. To validate our argument, we conduct a real experiments at an intersection in Pusan National University campus. From the numerical results, we demonstrate that the DC-GLOSA can reduce 23.9\% of the intersection stopping time (IST) on average.},

	abstract = {Transit Signal Priority (TSP) makes Public Transport (PT) more competitive to the private car by facilitating the movement of PT vehicles across signalised intersections. However, the acceptance of TSP is limited, as its application can result in delays to the general traffic. In the future traffic signals will broadcast Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) status information to nearby vehicles. Thanks to this, TSP could be complemented with in-vehicle systems such as Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) and Green Light Optimal Dwell Time Advisory (GLODTA). They allow a bus to pass through signalised intersections during a green phase, without modifying signal timings. Therefore they do not create delays to the general traffic. The objective of this paper is to analyse how the two systems can complement TSP and to which extend they can be used instead of TSP. Using computational experiments we demonstrate that although signal priority provides greater travel time improvement, the two advisory systems offer similar advantages in terms of reducing the number of stops and delay time at traffic signals.},

Ride comfort is one of the key components defining the quality. In this article, we demonstrate how the comfort can be improved if buses use a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) driver assistance system. It allows a driver to adjust speed of the bus as so that it can arrive at the intersection when the light is green. It increases comfort of the passengers, reduces fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions of the bus. We use a multi segment GLOSA, i.e., several lights in a sequence on route of a bus are taken into account in order to calculate speed advice. Such approach is useful if busways are separated from traffic. The speed optimisation method is based on a genetic algorithm. In addition, performance evaluation of a single-segment GLOSA for bus operations in mixed traffic is also evaluated. Using computational experiments we demonstrate that when compared with conventional driving, where speed is not planned, the use of GLOSA results in significant improvement in ride smoothness.},

We introduce a real-time prediction algorithm and back-end implementation that is able to generate signaling predictions based on historical Signal Phase and Timing information (SPaT) for adaptive traffic lights of an entire urban area. Our approach is able to meet the requirement of dealing with high latency times for historical data and incomplete data sets.

	abstract = {Smart transportation, which is an important dimension of smart cities, includes both intelligent and “green” transportation solutions. Cycling, as one of the most sustainable forms of transportation, is and should be an important component of smart cities. Electric bicycles, which are the most popular electric vehicles, subscribe to this type of transportation. They have several advantages when compared with traditional bicycles but have issues that relate to battery-limited capacity and long periods of charging as well. Consequently, energy-efficient solutions for electric bicycles are of very high research interest. Research on vehicular-communications-based energy-efficient solutions for electric vehicles is still in the early stages. Among electric vehicles, electric bicycles distinguish themselves as a special class as they have different characteristics and road-related requirements. This paper proposes a novel vehicular-communications-based speed advisory system for electric bicycles. The solution recommends strategic riding (i.e., the appropriate speed) when bicycles are approaching a signaled intersection to avoid high-power-consumption scenarios. The proposed approach includes a fuzzy-logic-based wind-aware speed adaptation policy, as, among all the other vehicles, bicycles are mostly affected by wind. Experimental results based on a real testbed and extensive simulation-based testing demonstrate that, by using the proposed solution, significant energy savings are recorded. In addition, an analysis on comfort-related metrics shows that the proposed solution can also contribute to improving the cycling experience.},

	abstract = {Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems aim at giving ideal target speed recommendations to the driver when approaching a traffic light to lower CO2 emissions (and fuel consumption) and to reduce the number of unnecessary stops. These systems have been shown to work well with static traffic light programs, unfortunately, a large portion of traffic lights in inner cities are adaptive and can change their behaviour with almost no lead time. This paper presents and validates (using field tests and simulation) a method to help overcome this problem and forecast fully and semi-adaptive traffic lights. First, we transformed the state graph of the traffic light controller into a transition graph focusing on signal changes and their occurrence probability. We then reduced routing possibilities within the graph using real life observations and recorded detector data of the traffic light. We further optimized our system in terms of needed storage and computationally efficiency. Our results show that in 80\% of all cases we could predict signal changes 15s in the future with a high enough accuracy to enable GLOSA for adaptive traffic lights.},

	abstract = {Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems have been shown to be able to reduce both CO2 emissions and fuel consumption by giving drivers speed recommendations when approaching a traffic light. For the system to reach its maximum potential, is is necessary to properly predict all different types of traffic lights, that is, also adaptive traffic lights where signals may change with lead times as short as 1 s. In previous work we presented an approach to predict these adaptive traffic lights using graph transformation. In this paper we demonstrate how to adequately parametrize such a graph based prediction approach and evaluate the accuracy of the signal prognosis. In a first step, we find feasible values for the proper creation of the prediction graph. This graph is the basis for all predictions and therefore directly influences the quality of the prognosis. We then assess the forecast in terms of correctness and deviation to measure the accuracy of the predictions. We were able to show a prognosis system with an accuracy of 95\% and a deviation of less than 2 s. Lastly, we discuss some criteria to compare different approaches of prognosis systems for adaptive traffic lights.},

An autonomous car can make more convenient, safer, and less energy intensive. In addition, Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems reduce the travel time and CO2 emission. In this paper, we propose a novel GLOSA, called R-GLOSA system to support to autonomous cars. We assume that an autonomous car can access to all traffic light schedules that it will encounter on its route. The route is divided into each segment according to traffic lights. In each segment, an autonomous car can communicate to Road Side Units (RSUs) distributed among the road. An autonomous car collects the road information transmitted by an RSU and then, it optimizes speed in order to arrive at the intersection when the light is green. The R-GLOSA system provides an autonomous car with speed advisory for each RSU's coverage. The simulation results show that an autonomous car using R-GLOSA system outperforms in terms of travel time and waiting time compared to using single-segment and multi-segment GLOSA system.},

This paper outlines how UVDs (N=60) interpreted and reacted to a driver with traffic light assistance system. We used a multi-driver simulator with three drivers driving in a car-following scenario. The lead driver was not a participant, but a confederate who was followed by two UVDs. The confederate was apparently equipped either with or without a traffic light assistance system. The traffic light assistance system consisted of two functionalities: a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory and a start-up assistance system with two different parametrizations. These functionalities aimed at preventing unnecessary changes in speed and reducing the start-up lost time after signal change. The results showed that UVDs benefited from the driving behavior of the confederate with traffic light assistance system. However, the assisted driving behavior was hardly understood and partly rated as aversive by the UVDs. We discuss how to enhance behavioral adaptation of UVDs. We also outline which negative consequences may result from encounters of driver with systems and UVDs. We assume that how UVDs react towards drivers with systems may be one factor contributing to a successful launch of such systems.},

Following unequipped vehicles’ drivers (UVDs) also adapt their driving behavior to the assisted one. On the other hand, safety issues can be found in encounters with UVDs who also perceive assisted driving behavior negatively. Therefore, in a multi-driver simulator study (N = 60 participants sorted in groups of n = 2 UVDs), we tested whether informing UVDs about the GLOSA of an assisted driver results in more behavioral adaptation of UVDs to the assisted driving behavior, less safety issues, and less frustration of UVDs. Two UVDs followed a lead vehicle driven by a confederate. The confederate was equipped with GLOSA and knew when traffic lights switched from green to red and, consequently, slowed down when approaching a green traffic light. The degree of information UVDs received was manipulated: The group “no information” did not receive any information. The group “information” knew about the equipment of the assisted confederate with GLOSA and the group “detailed information” received additional information about its functionality and benefit. Results show that UVDs of the group “detailed information” adapted their driving behavior to the assisted driver. However, these UVDs also showed smaller minimum time-to-collision (TTC) values indicating safety issues. Results are discussed and implications made with regard to providing information to UVDs and to further investigate these challenges in the context of autonomous vehicles.},

However, before any hardware/software infrastructure can be developed and implemented, a thorough phase of testing is warranted. Since actual vehicles and traffic conditions cannot be physically re-constructed, it is imperative that accurate simulation tools exist in order to model pragmatic traffic scenarios and communication amongst the participating vehicles. In order to realize this need of simulating V2X technology, we have created an integrated simulation environment that combines three software packages, VISSIM (traffic modelling), MATLAB (traffic management applications) and NS3 (communication network simulation). The combination of the simulators, has been carried out in a manner that allows on-line exchange of data amongst them. This enables one to visualize whether a traffic management algorithm creates the desired effect and also the efficacy of the communication protocol used. In order to test the simulator, we have modelled the Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA) application, whose objective is communication of the present traffic signal phase information to oncoming vehicles using a transmitting unit installed on the signal itself. This information will allow the vehicles to calculate the desired speeds necessary to cross the relevant intersection without stopping. Therefore, a “Green Wave” can be created for all vehicles without the need to coordinate traffic signal timers, which can be rather complex in a multiple intersection traffic corridor.},

	abstract = {In recent years, rapid technological breakthroughs in infrastructure-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure wireless communications have created the possibility of new concepts for traffic signal control. The green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA) approach uses traffic signal control information and the current position of a vehicle to recommend an appropriate speed for each vehicle, reducing the number of stops at traffic signals. Previous research mainly focused on the impact of GLOSA on the performance of movements on major streets. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of GLOSA on delay, capacity, and surrogate safety measures for vehicles that arrive from unsignalized side driveways and access roads. A highly calibrated and validated Vissim simulation model of a five-intersection segment of 3500 South, an urban corridor in Salt Lake City, Utah, was used as a test environment. Scenarios of various traffic loads and GLOSA activations have been defined and simulated. Outputs from Vissim were used to measure the impact of GLOSA. Vehicular trajectory files were postprocessed in the FHWA Surrogate Safety Assessment Model to analyze vehicular conflict data and thereby evaluate the traffic safety effects of GLOSA. The findings show that GLOSA often significantly affects delay of the side-street traffic. However, in general, GLOSA has only a minor impact on the number of conflicts. Regarding the impact of type of traffic control on GLOSA’s operations, the findings show that the fixed-time signals work better than actuated–coordinated signals, and road geometry and proximity of the signalized intersections affect the impact of GLOSA on the side-street traffic.},

	abstract = {Conceptually, a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system suggests speeds to vehicles, allowing them to pass through an intersection during the green interval. In previous papers, a single speed is computed for each vehicle in a range between acceptable minimum and maximum values (for example between standstill and the speed limit). This speed is assumed to be constant until the beginning of the green interval, and sent as advice to the vehicle. The goal is to optimise for a particular objective, whether it be minimisation of emissions (for environmental reasons), fuel usage or delay. This paper generalises the advice given to a vehicle, by optimising for delay over the entire trajectory instead of suggesting an individual speed, regardless of initial conditions – time until green, distance to intersection and initial speed. This may require multiple acceleration manoeuvres, so the advice is sent as a suggested acceleration at each time step. Such advice also takes into account a suitable safety constraint, ensuring that vehicles are always able to stop before the intersection during a red interval, thus safeguarding against last-minute signal control schedule changes. While the algorithms developed primarily minimise delay, they also help to reduce fuel usage and emissions by conserving kinetic energy. Since vehicles travel in platoons, the effectiveness of a GLOSA system is heavily reliant on correctly identifying the leading vehicle that is the first to be given trajectory advice for each cycle. Vehicles naturally form a platoon behind this leading vehicle. A time loop technique is proposed which allows accurate identification of the leader even when there are complex interactions between preceding vehicles. The developed algorithms are ideal for connected autonomous vehicle environments, because computer control allows vehicles’ trajectories to be managed with greater accuracy and ease. However, the advice algorithms can also be used in conjunction with manual control provided Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is available.},

In previous work we have shown that simulations tend to overestimate the communication quality to be expected in urban environments and that in a real-world test, IEEE 802.11p-based GLOSA cannot always reach the required information distance. Although multi-hop information dissemination can help alleviate this problem, it has not yet received much attention from the research community in the context of GLOSA systems. In this paper we present results from extensive field tests with almost 200 traffic light approaches. We find that two-hop dissemination of signal phase and timing information from traffic lights increases the maximum information distance by around 35\% and is able to support continuous updates even in challenging environments.},

In a first period, drivers had the information providing service disabled in order to establish a baseline behavior; after that initial phase, the service was activated. In both cases, data from smartphone and vehicle sensors was collected, including speed, acceleration, fuel rate, acceleration and brake pedal positions. We estimated the changes in the driving behavior which result from drivers' receiving the traffic signal timing information by carefully comparing distributions of acceleration/deceleration patterns through statistical analysis.

	abstract = {The connected vehicle eco-approach and departure (EAD) application for signalized intersections has been widely studied and is deemed to be effective in terms of reducing energy consumption and both greenhouse gas and other criteria pollutant emissions. Prior studies have shown that tangible environmental benefits can be gained by communicating the driver with the signal phase and timing (SPaT) information of the upcoming traffic signals with fixed time control to the driver. However, similar applications to actuated signals pose a significant challenge due to their randomness to some extent caused by vehicle actuation. Based on the framework previously developed by the authors, a real-world testing has been conducted along the El Camino Real corridor in Palo Alto, CA, USA, to evaluate the system performance in terms of energy savings and emissions reduction. Strategies and algorithms are designed to be adaptive to the dynamic uncertainty for actuated signal and real-world traffic. It turns out that the proposed EAD system can save 6\% energy for the trip segments when activated within DSRC ranges and 2\% energy for all trips. The proposed system can also reduce 7\% of CO, 18\% of HC, and 13\% of NOx for all trips. Those results are compatible with the simulation results and validate the previously developed EAD framework.},

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications have the potential to not only accelerate progress towards autonomous vehicles but also to facilitate the achievement of more appropriate driver behavior patterns and thus make traffic more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. This paper presents a driving advisory system for vehicles approaching traffic lights that is based on the use of a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system and evaluates its impact on traffic flow characteristics. This system, which assumes the existence of a connection with the traffic light ahead, calculates the distance required to pass through the intersection without stopping during the remaining green signal time. The required distance is then projected onto the road surface as a green planar rectangle shape through a head-up display (HUD). As long as the vehicle is traveling on the green rectangle, the drivers will not need to make a complete stop or accelerate again in order to meet the onset of a green signal. Assuming that all vehicles are equipped with our proposed system, traffic simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of the scheme. Numerical analyses showed that a higher fuel efficiency and lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were achievable, even under high-density traffic conditions, by combining the full and partial assistance levels of our proposed system.},

In previous papers, the authors have proposed a GLOSA system that informs drivers of the most appropriate position for their vehicle instead of their optimal speed. This paper reports on a performance evaluation of our proposed GLOSA system after application to morning rush-hour traffic flow in a simulation of a real-world signalized intersection. A performance evaluation of this numerical simulation showed that our GLOSA system increased the time headway of vehicles and decreased their deceleration rates in the vicinity of the signalized intersection. In addition, the use of the system moderately increased fuel efficiency without affecting vehicle travel time. From these results, it can be concluded that our proposed GLOSA system has the potential to create safer traffic flows in real-world signalized intersections without degrading traffic efficiency.},

These systems have been widely evaluated by means of simulation and, while most research focuses on the impact assessment of GLOSA along with environmental influences, minor attention was drawn to the holistic technical evaluation of included sub-modules and implementations. In this extended version of our IEEE VNC 2016 publication, we present a holistic concept for the technical evaluation of IEEE 802.11p-based GLOSA systems. We first give a comprehensive survey on GLOSA systems and studies all around the world and identify remaining problems. We introduce metrics to cover the whole spectrum of GLOSA operations and particularly focus on (modeling) problems we encountered in the field that are often not taken into consideration in simulation studies. We demonstrate how this concept can be used to evaluate the real-world GLOSA system tested in the European Commission co-funded field trial DRIVE C2X. Results derived from Field Operational Test (FOT) data show that our metrics are well-suited to assess the performance of the GLOSA system, and also to identify sources of potential problems or bottlenecks. Based on our findings, we argue that most GLOSA simulation studies are too optimistic in terms of communication performance. Lastly, we give recommendations on how real-world GLOSA systems can be further improved to support a sufficient level of performance.},

Frequent stops for red traffic lights at intersections are experienced by cyclists as a major inconvenience. This study introduces a green wave concept for cyclists, with focus on the traffic management and control aspects under cooperative intelligent transport systems applications. It especially addresses increasing stability of the adaptive control system, to overcome the drawbacks of both actuated and traditional adaptive control (which are too unpredictable for a green wave speed advice). In addition, solutions for avoiding increased delays for other traffic are investigated, as generally result from a classic green wave approach (with only fixed-time control) and traditional adaptive control. This study introduces an adaptive control algorithm for a real-time model-predictive controller and implements a plan-deviation cost function to address stabilisation. Simulation results show that the developed method increases stability of the adaptive control system, limits extra delays for other traffic and yields a high success rate for the green wave concept.},

	abstract = {This project focuses on a mode of transportation that is currently left out of V2X (vehicle-to-everything) conversations: bicycling. The project demonstrates how university researchers, city traffic engineers, and signal-controller manufacturers can come together to give bicyclists the same technology appearing on modern vehicles: Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA). GLOSA allows motorists to set their speed along corridors to maximize their chances of catching a “green wave” (i.e., not being forced to stop as they travel through the corridor). This project demonstrates how GLOSA can be used by bicyclists in the same way it is used by motorists on a busy car and bike corridor feeding the University of Oregon (UO) campus. The project attempts to answer two questions: (1) Can GLOSA information be conveyed to a phone carried by a bicyclist? (2) Can the information be presented in an effective, reasonable and safe manner using the interfaces available on the phone? For the former, the authors discuss their approach to combining (a) information provided by the city’s traffic office in terms of signal timing-tables with that of (b) a real-time traffic feed from the McCain Transparity server. They discuss a system architecture that they developed to use the real-time feed to keep an up-to-date view of signal state (current phase and its start time). However, if the feed was lost, the system continued to operate with its last known state information, potentially obtained by signal reset by the main office. The system architecture, and the app that employs it, uses the phone global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer sensors to keep an accurate view of the rider’s location, direction and speed. For their second question, the authors describe an app they developed and a set of trials they ran to test it. The overall results are positive. Testing revealed that the GLOSA-based app was effective, reasonable and safe on the test site.},

GLOSA aims to minimize trip time and fuel consumption by providing vehicles, via a wireless channel, with specific information to calculate an advisory speed to be respected when approaching a traffic light. However, Wireless communications are prone to packet loss and delay which could considerably impact applications and user experience. In this paper, we study the impact of network performance on the efficiency of GLOSA.

Traditional GLOSA system only considers the SPaT (Signal Phase and Timing) of traffic light. However, two another important factors, namely queuing effect and actual tracking error of drivers, are seldomly considered, which degrades the actual performance of the GLOSA system. Intelligent connected vehicles based on V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) have great application potential in solving this problem. In this study, firstly, a vehicle queue length estimation method based on V2I technology is proposed to predict the effective green light time. Secondly, a hierarchical GLOSA system is developed, where the upper layer provides the global recommended optimal speed aiming at minimizing energy consumption, while the bottom layer provides the modified recommended speed considering the driver's tracking error. Finally, the tracking error of the driver when executing the recommended speed is derived based on the real-world experiment. Corresponding simulation and field test platforms are also established. Results show that compared with the traditional GLOSA system, the improved GLOSA system considering the vehicle queuing effect and driving error can effectively improve the energy-saving performance of the vehicle.},

In this paper, we present a new method to calculate the optimal driving speeds based on traffic light data. To this end, a detailed formulation for the optimization problem is presented for a multi-segment route, based on an electric vehicle (EV) and traffic light models in an urban environment. Since this formulation results in a nonconvex optimization problem, a relaxation procedure is applied with a low calculation time. By using this procedure, a dynamic real-time speed advisory algorithm is developed. Numerical simulations showed improved performance over benchmark techniques. In particular, the proposed Dynamic-GLOSA solution’s performance was shown to be very close to that with a brute-force optimal solution but with a much shorter calculation time and has significant potential for energy saving.},

	abstract = {The literature on green mobility and eco-driving in urban areas has burgeoned in recent years, with special attention to using infrastructure to vehicle (I2V) communications to obtain optimal speed trajectory which minimize the economic and environmental costs. This article shares the concept with these studies but turns the spotlight on cyclists. It examines the problem of finding optimal speed trajectory for a cyclist in signalised urban areas. Unlike the available studies on motorised vehicles which predominantly designed for pre-defined, fixed traffic lights timing, this article uses an algorithm based on stochastic dynamic programming to explicitly address uncertainty in traffic light timing. Moreover, through a comprehensive set of simulation experiments, the article examines the impact of the speed advice’s starting point as well as the cyclist’s willingness for changing his/her speed on enhancing the performance. The proposed approach targets various performance metrics such as minimising the total travel time, energy consumption, or the probability of stopping at a red light. Hence, the resulting speed advice can be tailored according to the personal preferences of each cyclist. In a simulation case study, the results of the proposed approach is also compared with an existing approach in the literature.},

	abstract = {In recent years the percentage of cyclists in urban road traffic has constantly been growing all over the
world. Therefor increasing the importance to consider cyclists in traffic control, especially at signalized
intersections. Current traffic light controls (TLC) are often mainly constructed to optimize green
periods for motorized traffic, considering cyclists only insufficiently at most. Because of this, we have
developed a cooperative traffic light control (CTLC), which can consider cyclists as well as motorized
traffic equally, by using the future-oriented technology V2I. Cyclists are equipped with a V2I capable
Mobile Devices to enable their detection when approaching the intersection thereby request their
required phase. Furthermore, the green period for cyclists can be adjust by their expected arrival times
at intersections. The Modul for considering cyclists from CTLC, which has the potential to be integrated
in any kind of TLC, was first integrated in an existing TLC. Thus, the TLC is able to consider cyclists as
well as other common road users. The CTLC Mobile Devices of the cyclist additionally provides a
GLOSA-function, which informs the cyclists about the signal time of their required signal group during
the approach, and provides an estimated speed recommendation accordingly. The main purpose of
the CTLC is to reduce waiting times and stop numbers for cyclists. With the additional aim to minimize
and prevent negative effects on the remaining traffic. For evaluation a python code of the CTLC was
connected to an SUMO-network of an actual intersection in Braunschweig via TraCI. First simulations
expose positive effects for cyclists, reducing waiting times as well as the amount of required stops
while conserving or marginally enhancing the remaining traffic flow.},

	abstract = {The objective of eco-drive technology is to reduce fuel consumption and resulting emissions using advances in communication and traffic control technologies with capability to support infrastructure-to-vehicle connection in a signalized network. On the human factors side, there is growing interest across the world in advising drivers to take eco-drive actions by effectively using the green phase of the signal cycle time to save fuel and reduce emissions. This paper describes a large-scale real-world research project in Ottawa (Ontario, Canada) on this subject. The technology and methods that support the green light optimized speed advisory (GLOSA) system were refined and all 1,178 traffic signals in the city were equipped to connect with a fleet of vehicles. Field study data were analyzed for speed trajectories, fuel consumption, and GLOSA compliance. Greenhouse emissions and fuel cost changes were computed. An anonymous questionnaire study investigated driver perception of the usefulness of the signal data displayed on an in-vehicle unit as advice on driving adjustment decisions made under prevailing traffic conditions. The over 65\% compliance with GLOSA and the results of the driver questionnaire were mutually consistent. The fuel saving amounted to 7.6\% but was adjusted to 5\% because of uncertainties in daily vehicle travel. The reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent and fuel cost reported in the paper are based on a 5\% adjustment. These results can be used for cost?benefit studies. Also, simulation-based research projects can verify their findings with the real-world experience reported in this paper.},

How does it evolve with respect to the Market Penetration Rate (MPR) of connected vehicles? Here are some questions raised by this paper with a focus made on Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) strategy. Such a system, based on V2I communication, aims at providing speed advice/recommendations when approaching an intersection to adjust speed and enhance fuel consumption. The message is displayed on the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of the connected vehicles and a response is expected from the driver. This paper derives its interest in the response behaviour of the driver to HMI. It develops a two-stage methodology based on (i) Field Operational Test to collect realistic inputs (e.g., response rate, delay, deceleration profile, etc.) and (ii) a simulated environment used for extending the findings to non-observed cases (e.g. higher MPR). Besides, the methodology that is well-fitted for generic evaluation and comparison of pilots sites’ conclusions, one further contribution lies in the process to select the explaining factors. Factors are targeted among features of (i) the road configuration (e.g. number of lanes), (ii) the service configuration (e.g. activation distance), or (iii) the individual route choice and traffic conditions. Among others, it is highlighted that the activation distance plays a significant role in the response behaviour and, depending on the cycle duration, a short activation distance might be completely inefficient, while a true environmental impact requires high MPR.},

	abstract = {In this study, a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system for buses (B-GLOSA) was developed. The proposed B-GLOSA system was implemented on diesel buses, and field tested to validate and quantify the potential real-world benefits. The developed system includes a simple and easy-to-calibrate fuel consumption model that computes instantaneous diesel bus fuel consumption rates. The bus fuel consumption model, a vehicle dynamics model, the traffic signal timings, and the relationship between vehicle speed and distance to the intersection are used to construct an optimization problem. A moving-horizon dynamic programming problem solved using the A-star algorithm is used to compute the energy-optimized vehicle trajectory through signalized intersections. The Virginia Smart Road test facility was used to conduct the field test on 30 participants. Each participant drove three scenarios, including a base case uninformed drive, an informed drive with signal timing information communicated to the driver, and an informed drive with the recommended speed computed by the B-GLOSA system. The field test investigated the performance of using the developed B-GLOSA system considering different impact factors, including road grades and red indication offsets, using a split-split-plot experimental design. The test results demonstrated that the proposed B-GLOSA system can produce smoother bus trajectories through signalized intersections, thus producing fuel consumption and travel time savings. Specifically, compared to the uninformed drive, the B-GLOSA system produces fuel and travel time savings of 22.1\% and 6.1\%, on average, respectively.},

	abstract = {Information-sharing between traffic signals and connected vehicles can enhance the traffic conditions in signalized intersections. We propose a straightforward application, heads-up green, with the aim to inform queuing connected vehicles about a switch from red to green. In this way, the drivers’ reaction time is expected to be reduced and the number of vehicles that can pass the intersection during a cycle is thereby increased. Unlike the applications Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA), time-to-green and time-to-red, there is no need for predictions of future traffic signal states. Therefore, heads-up green can be used in traffic actuated and adaptive control strategies in signalized intersections without loss in precision. A simulation-based evaluation of a typical Swedish intersection with a traffic actuated controller is performed to evaluate the traffic performance. The main goal as been to show on the potential to use heads-up green to increase traffic efficiency in signalized intersections. Additionally, different reaction times to the information from heads-up green has been investigated. The results show that with heads-up green it is possible to improve the travel time by up to 15\% at high demand levels when queues are frequently observed. The improvements are largest with 100\% connected vehicles, but significant improvements of 5-15\% are observed also for lower shares of connected vehicles. At high demand levels, travel times are decreased already at small reductions in the reaction time. Hence, there is a potential to improve traffic efficiency already when small changes in reaction time can be achieved with heads-up green.},

Accurate SPaT messages can be used to construct a speed profile for a vehicle that reduces its fuel consumption as it approaches or leaves an intersection. This paper presents SPaT estimation algorithms at an intersection with a semi-actuated signal, using real-time signal phase measurements. The algorithms are evaluated using high-resolution data from an intersection in Montgomery County, MD, USA. The algorithms can be readily implemented at signal controllers. This paper supports three findings. First, real-time information dramatically improves the accuracy of the prediction of the residual time compared with the prediction based on historical data alone. Second, as time increases, the prediction of the residual time may increase or decrease. Third, as drivers differently weight errors in predicting “end of green” and “end of red,” drivers on two different approaches may prefer different estimates of the residual time of the same phase.},

	abstract = {As vehicle communication standards mature, protecting vulnerable road users (VRUs) using vehicle communication technology is looming as a promising and useful application. The current vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication as stipulated by the standard such as SAE J2735 implies that it is mainly the vehicles that take the responsibility for VRU protection. In this VRU protection framework, user devices are essentially beacons that transmit Personal Safety Messages (PSMs). Upon receiving these PSMs, the drivers (or autonomous vehicles) take necessary measures to protect them. We, however, believe that the road users could also use the information about nearby vehicles to avoid dangerous situations. This paper discusses how the most distracted road user type, i.e., smartphone users, can use the Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) from nearby vehicles to notice approaching danger and take appropriate defensive actions. We build a complete prototype based on the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) standards, and demonstrate how it can be used by pedestrians to notice imminent danger even while they are gazing at the smartphone screen.},

	abstract = {Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) have seen increased interest in recent years, with several ongoing activities and first practical implementations. While clearly V2X-communication will play a significant role in all C-ITS deployments, several key components, such as the wireless communication technology and the message formats, are still evolving. This calls for a modular approach when designing C-ITS infrastructure, especially when considering a real world urban environment. Such environments are characterized by heterogeneous traffic light hardware and traffic management systems. This paper focuses on the modular architecture of the C-ITS pilot in Dresden. For example, a highly flexible communication stack is developed for this special purpose. It fully supports the message types standardized by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) on the one hand, while on the other hand allowing the rapid implementation and test of novel message types and contents. This went hand in hand with the development of a modular roadside unit, enabling the rapid implementation of service applications on its central processing unit. In combination with a cloud-based backend, a real-time C-ITS service platform with a hybrid communication concept is developed. This paper presents a modular architecture and best practice guidelines based on experiences of the C-ITS pilot in Dresden. First results of research topics, such as latency measurements, are shown. The ongoing C-ITS deployment in Dresden is part of the initiative "Synchrone Mobilität 2023", which aims at advancing Intelligent Transport Systems. Focusing on automated and connected driving in urban areas, the research and development projects under its umbrella initiate scientific and technological developments and provide comprehensive test facilities. Automated and connected driving in urban areas requires not only simulations and test drives on test sites but also enormous testing effort under real traffic conditions. The Dresden Testbed offers outstanding conditions to conduct real-world test with a multitude of test kilometers and the experience of different traffic scenarios.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, a lot of applications have been developed for Vehicular Ad Hoc NETworks (VANETs) to exchange information between vehicles. However, VANET is basically a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) characterized by intermittent connectivity, long delays and message losses especially in low density regions [1]. Thus, VANET requires the use of an infrastructure such as Roadside Units (RSUs) that permits to enhance the network connectivity. Nevertheless, due to their deployment cost, RSUs need to be optimally deployed. Hence, the main objective of this work is to provide an optimized RSUs placement for delay-sensitive applications in vehicular networks that improves the end-to-end application delay and reduces the deployment cost. In this paper, we first mathematically model the placement problem as an optimization problem. Then, we propose our novel solution called ODEL. ODEL is a two-steps technique that places RSUs only in useful locations and allows both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication: (i) the first step is comprehensive study that looks for the RSUs candidates locations based on connectivity information, and (ii) the second step uses genetic algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm to reduce the number of RSUs based on the deliverance time requirement and the deployment cost. We show the effectiveness of our solution for different scenarios in terms of applications delay (reduced by up to 84\%) and algorithm efficiency (computation performance reduced by up to 79\% and deployment cost reduced at least by up to 23\%).},

A multi-objective formulation of the problem is introduced, considering the deployment cost, and a new model for quality-of-service is defined, accounting for both the traffic (number of vehicles and speed) and the coverage of street segments in the city. The related optimization problem is solved using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. The experimental analysis considers real scenarios in the city of Malaga, using realistic traffic information and real antennas. The reported results indicate that the proposed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is able to compute accurate trade-off solutions for the problem, significantly outperforming a greedy approach based on the ideas previously applied in the related literature.},

Reliable signal timing estimation integrated into Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory systems is one of the keys to minimizing unnecessary braking and accelerating in front of traffic lights. In this paper, we present experiments based on recorded real-world process data of traffic signals to predict the switching times of traffic actuated signals using machine learning. Traffic lights sign a limited number of signal combinations. We summarize these combinations into sets to obtain one feature depicting the signal state. This paper focuses on whether the inclusion of the (estimated) state as an input feature can achieve higher accuracy for the estimation of the switching times than those based only on signal information. Implementing XGBoost and Bayesian Networks, we found that a higher accuracy and a lower root mean square error are achieved by using states. Whether the actual or estimated next state improves the quality of the prediction, the most depends on the degree of traffic dependency and traffic load of the traffic light.},

	abstract = {With an ever-increasing population growth in cities around the world, continuous production of all kinds vehicles by manufacturers, and the number of vehicles on the roads will only continue to rise. This naturally leads to increased traffic congestion, especially in large metropolitan areas and even more so during peak rush hour time. This phenomenon constantly puts pressure on researchers, city officials, and urban planners to continue to improve traffic management systems in ways that are safer and economically more efficient. In order to address this evolving problem, a number of studies have been conducted that have resulted in some notable improvements such as designated lanes for emergency vehicles in urban areas. However, even with these lanes, often the ideal target-times for emergency vehicles to reach their destinations is hard to achieve. A new method which seeks to address this issue is called Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This method can help solve the problem by integrating existing technology with the current infrastructure. In this paper, our goal is to compare different methods for managing traffics, namely Traffic Light Systems (TLS): Static and Dynamic TLS, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Internet of Things (IoT). In the latter method, traffic data are quickly acquired and sent to Big Data for processing and mobile applications AKA User Interface (UI) to estimate traffic density in various areas in order to suggest alternative ways to alleviate traffic.},

The control algorithm is built on approximate dynamic programming (ADP). This approach substantially reduces computational burden by using an approximation to the value function of the dynamic programming and reinforcement learning to update the approximation. We investigate temporal-difference learning and perturbation learning as specific learning techniques for the ADP approach. We find in computer simulation that the ADP controllers achieve substantial reduction in vehicle delays in comparison with optimised fixed-time plans. Our results show that substantial benefits can be gained by increasing the frequency at which the signal plans are revised, which can be achieved conveniently using the ADP approach.},

Many cities across the world are beginning to shift their mobility solution away from the private cars and towards more environmentally friendly and citizen-focused means. Hamburg, Oslo, Helsinki, and Madrid have recently announced their plans to become (partly) private car free cities. Other cities like Paris, Milan, Chengdu, Masdar, Dublin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Bogota, and Hyderabad have measures that aim at reducing motorized traffic including implementing car free days, investing in cycling infrastructure and pedestrianization, restricting parking spaces and considerable increases in public transport provision. Such plans and measures are particularly implemented with the declared aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These reductions are also likely to benefit public health.
Aims
We aimed to describe the plans for private car free cities and its likely effects on public health.
Methods
We reviewed the grey and scientific literature on plans for private car free cities, restricted car use, related exposures and health.
Results
An increasing number of cities are planning to become (partly) private car free. They mainly focus on the reduction of private car use in city centers. The likely effects of such policies are significant reductions in traffic-related air pollution, noise, and temperature in city centers. For example, up to a 40\% reduction in NO2 levels has been reported on car free days. These reductions are likely to lead to a reduction in premature mortality and morbidity. Furthermore the reduction in the number of cars, and therefore a reduction in the need for parking places and road space, provides opportunities to increase green space and green networks in cities, which in turn can lead to many beneficial health effects. All these measures are likely to lead to higher levels of active mobility and physical activity which may improve public health the most and also provide more opportunities for people to interact with each other in public space. Furthermore, such initiatives, if undertaken at a sufficiently large scale can result in positive distal effects and climate change mitigation through CO2 reductions. The potential negative effects which may arise due to motorized traffic detouring around car free zone into their destinations also need further evaluation and the areas in which car free zones are introduced need to be given sufficient attention so as not to become an additional way to exacerbate socioeconomic divides. The extent and magnitude of all the above effects is still unclear and needs further research, including full chain health impact assessment modeling to quantify the potential health benefits of such schemes, and exposure and epidemiological studies to measure any changes when such interventions take place.
Conclusions
The introduction of private car free cities is likely to have direct and indirect health benefits, but the exact magnitude and potential conflicting effects are as yet unclear. This paper has overviewed the expected health impacts, which can be useful to underpin policies to reduce car use in cities.},

	abstract = {Cities across the world are beginning to shift away from private cars and towards more sustainable, healthy, just and inclusive mobilities. Hamburg, Oslo and Madrid have recently announced their plans to become (partly) car free. Despite the accepted importance of moving towards such transport systems, many cities struggle with the transition towards becoming car free. We describe the rationale, prerequisites, barriers, facilitators and strategies for car free cities. We describe 9 prerequisites to facilitate the transition towards becoming car free. Compact cities may be easier to refit to car free cities than sprawled cities. The main challenges will be how to change existing infrastructure that was mainly designed for cars to infrastructure for active and public transport, and how to change people’s perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. Retail interest and the car industry may be some of the biggest barriers. More research on cities in the vanguard of becoming car free is needed to urge this transition. Some cities have initiated strategies to create car free spaces. There is a need for creating good and feasible strategies and scenarios, and research evidence which can facilitate the move towards healthier cities.},

At least, this is apparent if we are to believe the multitude of innovators, start-ups, incumbent industries, policy actors and consultants proposing to harness the power of digital techniques to improve and transform cycling experiences, infrastructures, and gadgets. This ‘smartification of cycling’ is a phenomenon that is increasingly attracting attention and a variety of interests, fuelled both by the processes of transitioning to smart mobility and a boom of attention to cycling in cities worldwide. However, proposed cycling futures, both implicit and explicit, receive little critical scrutiny. Here, we fill this gap by mapping smart cycling innovations and their key features. We examine how innovations are believed to change the way cycling is practiced, made sense of and governed. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we analyse 86 website texts of smart cycling innovations and systematically outline changes envisioned by innovators. Having identified tensions between and within a range of promised futures, we conclude that smart cycling futures are multiple and contested, just as cycling presents are. Therefore, we propose a number of questions for further research to advance a more nuanced understanding of the range of futures of smart cycling in academic thinking and potentially to support decision-making at different levels of governance. Understanding diverse, contested, embodied and embedded cycling presents is part and parcel of imagining and co-creating (smart) cycling futures.},

Energy conservation focuses on reducing the total miles travelled by private cars. Supporting modal shift to public transport (PT) is the essential element of that strategy. It starts with policy support enabling time and space prioritisation of PT vehicles. Next, the emerging technologies can optimise performance and comfort of PT vehicles by making the best use of the assigned resources. This article shows how these technologies can reduce GHG emissions directly, as well as indirectly by making PT an attractive choice boosting patronage.

To achieve the stated purpose, materials are collected for research in developing and developed countries which comes from official sources including scientific articles, conference papers, books, and opinions from experts (from 2010 to 2020). This study identified 28 factors affecting the development of ITS projects. These factors are divided into 5 main groups namely the lack of undivided attention from the government, financial constraints, inadequate/incomplete transport infrastructure, the over-development of urbanization, the readiness and integration for ITS, which are analyzed depending on their influence. This study adds to the body of knowledge by offering new insights and contributes toward a greater understanding of mobility in a smart city. Furthermore, to guarantee sustainable ITS development, the digital infrastructure ecosystem should be extensively discussed. As a result, it created a useful measurement tool for government agencies, planners, and traffic system designers to help them self-assess and make action plans now or in the near future.},

In this context, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology is a well-study settlement. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and camera sensors are commonly used for localization and perception. However, through ten or twenty years of evolution, the LIDAR-SLAM method does not seem to have changed much. Compared with the LIDAR based schemes, the visual SLAM has a strong scene recognition ability with the advantages of low cost and easy installation. Indeed, people are trying to replace LIDAR sensors with camera only, or integrating other sensors on the basis of camera in the field of autonomous driving. Based on the current research situation of visual SLAM, this review covers the visual SLAM technologies. In particular, we firstly illustrated the typical structure of visual SLAM. Secondly, the state-of-the-art studies of visual and visual-based (i.e. visual-inertial, visual-LIDAR, visual-LIDAR-IMU) SLAM are completely reviewed, as well the positioning accuracy of our previous work are compared with the well-known frameworks on the public datasets.

Existing precise localization systems based on the global navigation satellite system cannot always provide lane-level accuracy even in open-sky environments. Map-based localization using high-definition (HD) maps is an interesting method for achieving greater accuracy. We propose a map-based localization method using a single camera. Our method relies on road link information in the HD map to achieve lane-level accuracy. Initially, we process the image—acquired using the camera of a mobile device—via inverse perspective mapping, which shows the entire road at a glance in the driving image. Subsequently, we use the Hough transform to detect the vehicle lines and acquire driving link information regarding the lane on which the vehicle is moving. The vehicle position is estimated by matching the global positioning system (GPS) and reference HD map. We employ iterative closest point-based map-matching to determine and eliminate the disparity between the GPS trajectories and reference map. Finally, we perform experiments by considering the data of a sophisticated GPS/inertial navigation system as the ground truth and demonstrate that the proposed method provides lane-level position accuracy for vehicle localization.},

Unsupervised machine learning analyses expose a cluster of experienced contributors classified as “OSM validators/experts”, which are then further used to attribute data quality. They are identified through a combination of strong contribution loadings associated with the use and experience of advanced OSM editors, and weaker loadings associated with feature creation and frequency of contributions leading to further correction.

These occur for instance, when only inaccurate prior information on position is available at initialization. The method uses lane-level accurate maps with dedicated attributes, such as connectedness and adjacency, and an automotive Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver assisted with dead-reckoning (DR) sensors. GNSS can be so inaccurate that map-matching relies mainly on DR estimates, the GNSS fixes being used as uncertain estimates with protection levels. This paper proposes a formalization of the map-matching integrity problem as well as a sequential method using a Particle Filter providing a reliable set of map-matched hypotheses.

Additionally, in safety applications or in those with critical performance requirements (such as satellite-based electronic fee collection), integrity becomes a key word for the navigation community. In this scenario, it is clear that a navigation system that can operate at the lane level while providing integrity parameters that are capable of monitoring the quality of the solution can bring important benefits to these applications. This paper presents a pioneering novel solution to the problem of combined positioning and map matching with integrity provision at the lane level. The system under consideration hybridizes measurements from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, an odometer, and a gyroscope, along with the road information stored in enhanced digital maps, by means of a multiple-hypothesis particle-filter-based algorithm. A set of experiments in real environments in France and Germany shows the very good results obtained in terms of positioning, map matching, and integrity consistency, proving the feasibility of our proposal.},
