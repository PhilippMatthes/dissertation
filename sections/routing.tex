\section{Introduction}

The mobility behavior in urban environments is becoming increasingly intermodal. The trend is moving towards a multimodal mobility planning \cite{park_framework_2023}, where bike-sharing and bike routes also play a significant role. Understanding cyclists' behaviors, particularly their route choices, is crucial not only for calculating preferences for suitable cycling routes but also as a fundamental aspect of expanding cycling infrastructure and urban planning \cite{zielstra_comparative_2011, huber_modelling_2021}. Models that replicate cyclists' route choices provide immediate insights into where cycling infrastructure should receive high priority. Thus, the application scenarios of bike routing are versatile and not strictly limited to navigation solutions.

To generate accurate routes for cyclists, one of the main challenges lies in the high individuality and context dependence of chosen paths \cite{dill_revisiting_2016, schleinitz_german_2017, misra_modeling_2018}, in which a multitude of criteria influence the optimal route \cite{song_exploring_2014}. Varying road conditions, the chosen bicycle type, and personal preferences play a large role in route choices. Spontaneous deviations also play a role, requiring appropriate rerouting.

In the context of GLOSA applications, routing is linked to additional factors. Here, an accurate alignment of the bike route with actual cycling infrastructure plays a large role in precisely determining upcoming traffic lights. Accounting for bends or obstacles on the way to the traffic light ensures accurate distance estimation, preventing the speed recommendation from deviating from the actual speed. Additionally, factors such as route incline and road conditions may impact a user's ability to follow given speed advisories, in addition to their influence on route choice. Accurate and consistent meta-information is desirable in these cases and can be obtained from an open or commercial routing foundation.

Considerations about global coverage, transparency, extensibility, copyright, privacy, costs, and vendor lock-ins are relevant in choosing the best option. Various acknowledged routing apps, such as Openrouteservice\footnote{\url{https://openrouteservice.org/}}, Photon and Komoot\footnote{\url{https://photon.komoot.io/}}, and Mapbox\footnote{\url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapbox}}, resort to OpenStreetMap routing, which provides good conditions in all of these aspects. Apple Maps and Bing Maps also use OpenStreetMap wherever no commercial data providers are available\footnote{\url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Apple}, \url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bing_Maps}}. 

Despite being an established and recognized map foundation, an ongoing issue is that Open\allowbreak Street\allowbreak Map's accuracy and consistency are not always as high as desired. Due to its Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) concept \cite{wasserman_evaluating_2019, jacobs_openstreetmap_2020, vybornova_automated_2023}, people with varying levels of expertise and preferences contribute to the map foundation. With a highly engaged user base and various company-level contributors, OpenStreetMap profits from frequent updates. However, similar to Wikipedia, not all contributions are of high quality. As a result, bike paths are not always captured as separate geometries from the road or tagged with the correct properties. In consequence, bike routes generated with OpenStreetMap are subject to imperfections and routing errors.

To reduce the number of bike routing errors and improve the overall alignment of generated routes with the cycling infrastructure, we will investigate another opportunity in this section. The opportunity presents itself in the form of an authoritative dataset, the "Digitales Radnetz Hamburg" (Digital Cycling Network Hamburg, DRN)\footnote{\url{https://metaver.de/trefferanzeige?docuuid=EA847D9F-6403-4B75-BCDB-73F831F960C7}}, which is publicly available and contains all bike paths in Hamburg. Such datasets are created and maintained by local institutes, usually conveying a higher level of quality assurance and overall correctness \cite{englede_efficient_2013, brovelli_towards_2017}. The goal is to leverage this authoritative dataset to obtain a more accurate bike routing for our app, identifying concrete processing methods to serve as a blueprint for other municipalities.

One issue of authoritative datasets is their spatial limitedness to a specific region. In the case of DRN, it is restricted to the city of Hamburg, making routing across city borders challenging. Allowing cross-border routing is an essential step towards combining multiple authoritative models into one intertwined patchwork of accurate routing networks. In this chapter, we will investigate a potential solution for this problem, cutting out the regions supported by DRN from OpenStreetMap and stitching both datasets together along the boundary. As a result, we obtain a hybrid bike routing network on which the process could be repeated for other cities. After generating our hybrid routing foundation, we will investigate the routing foundation's integration in our bike-GLOSA app. This includes a study of elevation providers for route personalization, investigating distance-to-signal estimation, developing a method for rerouting, as well as updating the map material on a regular basis.

A key focus is evaluating how much the accuracy of traffic light matching can be improved with a potentially more precise representation of cycling paths, compared to results from \Cref{ch:matching}. The primary contribution is determining the effectiveness of routing based on this type of dataset by comparing alignment with the actual location of cycling infrastructure and the number of routing errors. The goal is to ascertain whether adopting authoritative routing foundations can effectively address many of the issues encountered with OpenStreetMap bike routing, thereby providing users of the bike-GLOSA app with significantly improved directions and speed recommendations.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:rw-uis}

Establishing an accurate bike routing is a multifaceted research area. One avenue of investigation focuses on models that can predict cyclists' route choices with high accuracy based on available metadata \cite{dill_understanding_2008, ghanayim_modelling_2018, huber_modelling_2021}. This involves correlating GNSS trajectories with routing networks to understand the relationships between path characteristics and route selection \cite{sultan_extracting_2017, huber_modelling_2021}. Some studies also focus on safe bike routing \cite{loidl_online_2018}, popularity-based routing \cite{bergman_conflation_2016} or the short-term effects of infrastructure changes on cyclists' route preferences \cite{yeboah_route_2015, pritchard_does_2019}. Over the years, open-source routing engines such as GraphHopper\footnote{\url{https://www.graphhopper.com/}} have continuously improved, providing community- and research-tested routing profiles tailored for various types of cycling \cite{krismer_elevation_2016}. Thus, although research around understanding cyclist route choices is still ongoing, available route choice models can already be considered quite advanced and consolidated.

As Huber et al. (2021) \cite{huber_modelling_2021} have demonstrated, achieving a high level of accuracy in bike route choice prediction is strongly tied to having highly consistent meta-information about inclination, bike path type, surface quality, and also speed limits of surrounding motorized traffic. Using these attributes as additional decision criteria to route distance, the authors were able to model bike routing decisions with an accuracy of 88.6\% relative to GNSS trajectories. Thus, there is still room for improvement. However, route choice models are naturally limited to the consistency of such meta-information within the utilized map material, not only the overall completeness and accuracy of the depicted bike paths.

As a consequence, bike routing decision models highly depend on enhancements made in both the accuracy and consistency of routing foundations. In the following sections, we will investigate the status quo and which potentials for map improvement are currently under investigation. Specifically, we will investigate related works that utilize external authoritative datasets to improve the overall quality and alignment of bike path segments. Subsequently, we will delve into several challenges for GLOSA systems where precise routing emerges as a key solution.

\subsection{Bike Path Consistency and Accuracy in Routing Foundations}

How accurately and consistently a bike routing can be performed depends on the specific kind of routing foundation: VGIs such as OpenStreetMap, commercial providers such as Google Maps or Bing Maps, or authoritative infrastructure datasets.

Which routing foundation is best among multiple options is not a question that can be easily answered. Comparative research indicates that Google Maps and Bing Maps do not necessarily provide a more consistent and accurate depiction than OpenStreetMap. Ciepluch's early investigation in 2010 \cite{ciepluch_comparison_2010} revealed that Google Maps, Bing Maps, and OpenStreetMap did not significantly differ in quality, with no platform emerging as a clear winner, while notable variations between cities could be identified. Of course, these results need to be seen in a time context and may not be valid anymore. 

However, recent studies come to similar findings. Franzini et al. (2020) \cite{franzini_assessment_2020} found that only 40\% of the Pavia region in Italy is fully mapped in OpenStreetMap and 30\% in Google Maps, based on 2018 data. In other cities, the situation is considerably more favorable. Hochmair et al. (2015) \cite{hochmair_assessing_2015}, specifically assessing the coverage of bicycle infrastructure, found Portland to cover 86.4\% of 26 km of bicycle trails in OpenStreetMap and 78.4\% in Google Maps. This result stands in large contrast to the reported numbers for Miami, where only 22.8\% (OpenStreetMap) and 36.5\% (Google Maps) of 22 km of reference paths were accurately recorded, with a significant omission of paths along recreational sites such as rivers and parks. Thus, some cities require more substantial improvements to the mapping quality than others. The differences in mapping completeness between cities can be substantial.

There also seem to be systematic issues that are not bound to specific cities. Ferster et al. (2019) \cite{ferster_using_2019} and Wasserman et al. (2019) \cite{wasserman_evaluating_2019} highlighted inconsistencies in meta-information about bike path quality in OpenStreetMap, impacting the determination of bikeability. Vybornova et al. (2023) \cite{vybornova_automated_2023} demonstrated that connectivity issues in bicycle path segments could disrupt meaningful route calculations. These disconnected bike path segments may arise from false editations to the map material.

In recent years, multiple solutions have been proposed that focus on flagging these issues for manual correction. In this course, authoritative datasets have been used as ground truths to identify issues, as demonstrated by various studies \cite{haklay_how_2010, jokar_arsanjani_quality_2015, ludwig_comparison_2011}. Brovelli et al. (2017) \cite{brovelli_towards_2017} introduced a framework for comparing open reference map data with OpenStreetMap, focusing on enhanced reusability. In their work, the authors propose specific metrics that can be utilized to identify city areas in which the mapping quality is exceptionally low.

Apart from flagging and quality-assurance helpers, there are also works that investigate automated error correction solutions. For example, Vybornova et al. (2023) \cite{vybornova_automated_2023} recently suggested a method to detect and rectify missing connections between bike paths. Nasiri et al. (2018) \cite{nasiri_improving_2018} introduced a multi-stage approach in which outliers are detected and removed from OpenStreetMap edit histories, improving the positional precision of features by 14\% in Teheran.  

Authoritative datasets have been investigated to fill in missing or inconsistent meta information for paths, by combining paths from the authoritative dataset to the OpenStreetMap network. Both Szwoch (2018) \cite{szwoch_combining_2019} and Fan et al. (2016) \cite{fan_polygon-based_2016} examine map-matching methods that have established themselves as a valuable tool to bridge topological differences between slightly offset map sources \cite{chao_survey_2020}. In a recent study, Meister et al. (2023) \cite{meister_route_2023} investigated cyclists' route choices in Zurich, using map-matching to incorporate metadata from a municipal dataset due to OpenStreetMap's insufficient consistency. The geometrical precision of OpenStreetMap bike path segments was not enhanced.

Two studies also employ a geometric modification to the path network. Smarzaro et al. (2021) \cite{smarzaro_creation_2021} investigated such an approach to reach a higher path coverage for multimodal routing. Their method involves comparing geospatial features from external datasets to nearby paths, adding new features if they don't overlap with existing ones. Li et al. (2017) \cite{li_optimized_2017} demonstrate the integration of OpenStreetMap into an authoritative bikeway dataset to primarily enhance coverage. Their semi-automated approach involves preprocessing datasets, an automatic conflation that maps metadata between formats, and human-in-the-loop adjustments for matching quality evaluation. 

Both studies convey promising methods, although no specific evaluation with ground truth, i.e., the actual position of bike paths, is presented. In general, more investigation is required to investigate the impacts of such a routing on general routing errors, alignment with bike paths, and the impacts of routing on traffic light matching as a crucial functionality for GLOSA applications.

\subsection{Routing in GLOSA Applications}

Building on the collected understanding of general challenges in routing, we will now focus on ongoing challenges in GLOSA applications that are directly or indirectly related to routing.

In a study by Sharara et al. (2019) \cite{sharara_impact_2019}, it has been shown that drivers need a considerable amount of time to adapt to the speed advisory. One important factor for a timely speed advisory activation is detecting as early as possible during the ride which traffic light will be passed. 

As one possible solution, Mahler et al. (2012) \cite{mahler_reducing_2012} proposed using Google Maps to generate a route, selecting traffic lights even before the ride has started. As we have shown in \Cref{ch:matching}, most current approaches to select traffic lights are based on snapping the user location to the nearest traffic light geometry \cite{katsaros_performance_2011, bernais_design_2016, wilson_driver_2017, stahlmann_exploring_2018, bhattacharyya_assessing_2022}, not considering the predicted turns or general trajectory of the user. This leads to the issue that most current approaches delay the speed advisory's activation until a sufficient match can be determined. In some cases, the speed advisory may be hidden from the user even close to the traffic light due to a missing match \cite{wilson_driver_2017, stahlmann_exploring_2018}.

In our work (2022 -- 2023) \cite{matthes2022matching, matthes2023geo}, we developed a matching procedure bringing the approach envisioned by Mahler et al. (2012) \cite{mahler_reducing_2012} into practice. Finding errors in the generated OpenStreetMap bike routes, the developed model was designed in a robust way, such that routing errors and inaccuracies were circumvented. Nonetheless, it was determined that attaining more accurate bike routes could benefit the described approach and provide a more accurate matching.

Another ongoing challenge is the practicality of multi-segment GLOSA. Proposed by Seredynski et al. (2013) \cite{seredynski_comparison_2013, seredynski_multi-segment_2013}, the idea of such systems is calculating an optimal speed for multiple consecutive traffic lights instead of only one, further decreasing the energy consumption of a vehicle. This method was further investigated by Xu et al. (2015) \cite{xu_bb_2015}, De Nunzio et al. (2015) \cite{de_nunzio_eco-driving_2015}, Nguyen et al. (2016) \cite{nguyen_efficient_2016}, and Simchon et al. (2020) \cite{simchon_real-time_2020}. 

In the previously mentioned analysis by Sharara et al. (2019) \cite{sharara_impact_2019}, a multi-segment GLOSA approach was found to be more robust against poor network performance. Nonetheless, at the moment, this idea has not been tested outside of simulations or controlled test beds. Predicting multiple consecutive intersections in a real environment is considered an ongoing challenge in GLOSA systems by Mellegård et al. (2020) \cite{mellegard_day_2020}. Performing accurate routing to more reliably select traffic lights in advance would represent one possible avenue for multi-segment approaches.

Strongly tied to accurate routing is also the task of distance-to-signal estimation. A precise estimate is required for all GLOSA applications that provide a direct speed advisory to the user. However, many studies neglect the opportunity to address this aspect in more detail, assuming that a straight-line distance between the user location and the traffic light is sufficiently accurate \cite{iglesias_i2v_2008, katsaros_performance_2011, koukoumidis_signalguru_2011, koukoumidis_leveraging_2012, krause_traffic_2012, li_open_2012, stevanovic_green_2013, stevanovic_comparative_2014, eckhoff_potentials_2013, gajananan_cooperative_2013, tal_vehicular-communications-based_2016, bernais_design_2016, stebbins_characterising_2017, sharara_impact_2019}. 

Only two studies suggest a different method for distance-to-signal estimation. In a study by Hao et al. (2019) \cite{hao_eco-approach_2019}, a map-matching algorithm is mentioned that positions the vehicle on its predefined trajectory along the test traffic lights. Xie et al. (2021) \cite{xie_dynamic_2021} utilize a predefined bus route to calculate the distance to the next intersection. These approaches could enhance the distance estimation in the presence of an accurate routing, also providing the potential to rectify the issue of GNSS inaccuracies. However, so far, these aspects have only been addressed on a superficial level.

Finally, another area for improvement in which routing plays a large role is context adaptivity. As discussed by Fickas et al. (2019) \cite{fickas_fast_2019}, cyclist applications of GLOSA demand a speed advisory to be given in a sensitive manner. Other studies by Tal et al. (2016) \cite{tal_vehicular-communications-based_2016} and Dabiri et al. (2020) \cite{dabiri_optimized_2020} conducted on cyclists investigate wind speeds as the main influencing factor for a speed advisory system. However, the bike path surface quality also plays a large role in bikeability \cite{wasserman_evaluating_2019} in addition to the path inclination, which has been studied as an influencing factor in studies on cars as well \cite{zhang_green_2020}. The necessary information could be acquired using a routing system, opening up new possibilities for a sensible speed advisory.

\begin{Summary}[Summary of Research Gap]
The main area for improvement in bike routing is the accuracy of bike maps. It is widely acknowledged that the depiction of bike paths in OpenStreetMap, but also in competitors such as Google Maps or Bing Maps, is often not ideal. Authoritative map material is often used as a ground truth to detect errors in the map foundations, but only a few studies investigate how authoritative maps could be utilized directly to improve a routing foundation's quality. Apart from utilizing map matching to gather more consistent metadata from the authoritative maps, two studies have focused on hybridizing VGIs with authoritative datasets, providing overall promising outlooks for the option to route on authoritative data. Instead of merging entire regions, these works have focused on merging individual paths. A more thorough investigation of the gainable accuracy relative to actual cycling infrastructure and intersection topologies is also required. Although there is a large variety of authoritative datasets, not all of these datasets may have a common format or quality, complicating the search on cross-sections for concept reusability.

Secondly, routing provides various new avenues for GLOSA research but has not been seen as an integral component thus far. Current approaches for traffic light matching lack consideration for predicted turns and user trajectory, resulting in delayed or even non-activation of speed advisories. Route-based approaches, seen as key enablers for multi-segment GLOSA systems, require more accurate bike routes to enhance traffic light matching accuracy. Distance-to-signal estimation is often oversimplified, with limited studies exploring alternatives to straight-line distance calculations. The potential of map-matching algorithms in addressing GNSS inaccuracies and improving distance estimation is also underexplored. Lastly, the context adaptivity of GLOSA systems for cyclists, considering factors like path surface quality and inclination, remains another area for improvement. Through delivering inclination and surface information, routing systems could play a pivotal role in acquiring necessary information for a more sensitive and tailored speed advisory, presenting an avenue for future research and development.
\end{Summary}

\section{Concept}

The concept aims to address the described research gaps in two ways. First, we develop a concept for substituting regions in OpenStreetMap with a patch obtained from our authoritative dataset, DRN. Focusing on the reusability of our concept, this substitution can then be repeated for other regions, ultimately obtaining a patchwork of accurate routing networks. To scale our approach, we focus on automating every step in the processing pipeline through error-correction methods without the necessity of human intervention. As a result, we obtain a hybrid routing network that can be inserted into practically every routing engine that supports the existing OpenStreetMap format.

In the second part of our concept, we focus on the routing's integration into our bike-GLOSA app. Making use of the full automatability of our concept, we develop an integration pipeline that delivers day-accurate map materials to the app's users. We discuss how route personalization is realized and which digital elevation model is selected to provide inclination-sensitive routing. Afterward, we address the described scarcity in investigations of distance-to-signal estimation by discussing our concrete method in more detail, including the role of routing in our GNSS error correction. To complete the picture, we will take a brief excursion on our method for automated rerouting.

\subsection{DRN Routing}

The DRN dataset serves as an authoritative routing network for the city of Hamburg, specifically designed for bicycle paths. Published by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, Department for Traffic and Mobility Transition (BVM), it is made available under the DL-DE BY-2.0\footnote{\url{https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/by-2-0}} license. Notably, the dataset undergoes continuous updates and is currently in production as of December 27, 2023. Users can access the dataset through a public interface at no cost. 

Distinguished by its routing capability, the dataset encompasses interconnected segments forming a graph, including roads designated for cyclists when dedicated bike paths are unavailable. Covering the entire area of Hamburg, it is possible to replace this area from OpenStreetMap with DRN data. Nevertheless, there are disparities between the two datasets that necessitate overcoming. The following sections will outline the necessary processing steps.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-drn-osm-intersection.pdf}
\caption{Alignment of OpenStreetMap vs. DRN with the intersection topology.}
\label{fig:comparison}
\end{figure}

Firstly, the specification in which DRN is presented poses a challenge, requiring a meaningful mapping of DRN's numerous custom path categories to the OpenStreetMap format. Additionally, the geometry of DRN differs from that of OpenStreetMap. Looking at \Cref{fig:comparison} to obtain an initial view of the differences between both datasets, bike paths are usually mapped as separate geometries, generally aligning better with traffic light geometries (denoted in red). However, some secondary paths or roads not intended for cyclists are absent in DRN, requiring additional attention.

An area where the geometric discrepancy becomes problematic is the boundary between both datasets, demarcated by Hamburg's city border. A meaningful connection between the path segments needs to be established to support cross-border routing, even in the presence of imperfect alignments between the path networks. To address this challenge, a stitching procedure will be employed. However, as subsequent sections will reveal, we will face some more routing issues due to the special geometric properties of the DRN dataset. These will also be addressed to obtain a geometrically harmonized hybrid routing foundation. 

Once metadata and geometric structures are harmonized, our final routing foundation will be established. This foundation will enable routing within Hamburg using the DRN dataset and beyond its borders on OpenStreetMap.

\subsubsection{Metadata Harmonization}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-drn.pdf}
\caption{An overview of the DRN dataset and its bike path types, as of Dec 23, 2023.}
\label{fig:drn-map}
\end{figure}

A zoomed-out perspective on the DRN dataset is given in \Cref{fig:drn-map}. The dataset can be downloaded as CSV, GeoJSON, or GML. These formats are typical for geodata but require additional processing to translate them to the specialized \texttt{.osm} format, in which path geometries are given with specific OpenStreetMap attributes. The \texttt{.osm} format allows routing engines to understand bike surface properties and weigh them accordingly through bike-tailored routing profiles.  

Thus, to establish a conversion process from DRN to the \texttt{.osm} format, not only the geometries have to be transformed. Providing the most accurate routing possible requires converting path properties as well. Among others, the following properties are mapped\footnote{The displayed statistics represent a snapshot of the 27th of December 2023.}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Direction of travel (99626 segments bidirectional and 95212 segments unidirectional)
    \item Time restrictions (32 segments affected)
    \item Temporary paths such as pop-up lanes or detours (83 segments affected)
    \item If a segment is associated with a specific velo route or designated bike tours (Freizeitroute)
    \item Level (96237 flat, 1121 across bridges, 186 through tunnels)
    \item Obstacles (456 impassable, 52 can be circumvented, e.g. via footpath)
    \item The type of bike path and its surface, as illustrated in \Cref{fig:drn-map}
    \item Target and end node ID of the segment connecting the segments to a graph
    \item The segment's coordinates in EPSG:25832\footnote{\url{https://epsg.io/25832}}
\end{itemize}

These properties are utilized to infer a corresponding OpenStreetMap class, transforming the DRN dataset into the OpenStreetMap format. This approach of format harmonization lays the foundation for merging both datasets together at the city border. As another benefit, it allows us to reuse existing OpenStreetMap data loaders for routing engines without having to write a custom plugin.

The challenge here is that there is no one-to-one match between all DRN properties and OpenStreetMap properties. For example, DRN specifies three types for compacted surface: "befestigt - nicht genauer erkennbar", "befestigt - zu detailieren" and "Wassergebundene Decke". To resolve this problem, a mapping was developed that assumes the OpenStreetMap tags from the DRN specification. 

The final mapping highlighted in \Cref{tab:tag-mapping} includes the bike path's surface, level, direction, and type. In cases where the bike path's properties cannot be directly mapped to a suitable OpenStreetMap tag, the path is tagged with \texttt{highway=tertiary}. This fallback corresponds to established mapping practices in Germany. The result is an inferred set of tags for each path in the OpenStreetMap format, completing the metadata harmonization process.

\subsubsection{Geometric Harmonization}

After the conversion of metadata, the second step is geometric harmonization. However, before we can merge both datasets together, there are still two issues that need further attention: detours resulting from duplicated nodes in the graph and detours because the road cannot be crossed. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/node-merging.png}
\caption{Duplicated nodes (left) are merged together (right) to avoid detours.}
\label{fig:node-merging}
\end{figure}

Each individual path in the DRN dataset starts and ends in a node, which must be transformed into OpenStreetMap nodes that connect the individual paths to a graph structure\footnote{\url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node}}. To ease this process, the DRN dataset provides node IDs for the start and end points of each path. Thus, two OpenStreetMap nodes need to be generated for each DRN path based on the start and end coordinates given in the line geometry. 

Since there may be multiple DRN paths that are connected to a single OpenStreetMap node, the same node is generated multiple times during dataset processing. In theory, this should not be a problem since the node ID can be utilized to avoid duplicates. In practice, however, sometimes there are nodes for which multiple different coordinates are found in the dataset, presumably due to floating point inaccuracies of a preceding geographic projection step during dataset publishing. As highlighted in \Cref{fig:node-merging}, this leads to the issue of duplicated OpenStreetMap nodes in the proximity of a few centimeters that are not properly connected.

The developed solution involves merging all found coordinates for a specific node ID into a center point. Let $C_k = \{c_{k_1} = (lat_{k_1}, lng_{k_1}), \text{...} , c_{k_n} = (lat_{k_n}, lng_{k_n})\}$ be the collected coordinates for each node $k$. Then, the center point $\text{Center}_{\text{k}}$ is calculated as the mean of all coordinates for that node ID:

\begin{equation}\text{Center}_{\text{k}} = \left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|C_k|} \text{{lat}}_{k_i}}{|C_k|}, \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|C_k|} \text{{lng}}_{k_i}}{|C_k|}\right)\end{equation}

This method assumes small distances between the coordinates that are not noticeably affected by the curved WGS84 projection system. The maximum relocation distance between all $\text{Center}_{\text{k}}$ and $c \in C_k$ was calculated as 8.3 centimeters using the haversine formula. Based on this preliminary validation, no further points are falsely connected. Thus, this first issue could be resolved without any further challenges and without manual processing.

The second issue in the DRN dataset requiring additional processing is non-crossable roads, as highlighted in \Cref{fig:oneway-travel-fix}. Since bike paths on both roadsides are captured as individual geometries in the DRN dataset, there may be long road segments with bike paths running in parallel. However, without interconnections between the roadsides, there is also no possibility for the route to cross the road. Sometimes, this represents a problem since side roads attached to the opposite roadside can only be reached by long detours. With OpenStreetMap, this is a lesser problem since roads are often captured as single-path geometries without a clear distinction between each roadside. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/oneway-travel-fix.png}
\caption{Detour (left) that can be fixed by enabling opposite-direction one-way travel on foot (right), compared to OpenStreetMap route (blue).}
\label{fig:oneway-travel-fix}
\end{figure}

One explored solution is the introduction of "virtual" paths connecting the roadsides. Using these paths, the route could traverse between roadsides and avoid detours. Although this concept may sound like a reasonable idea at first, the question is where to place these virtual paths. For example, one could place these paths in a fixed interval along a road between roadsides. However, there could always be a physical barrier between both roadsides, meaning that generated routes would guide users over impassable obstacles or potentially encourage dangerous maneuvers. Traversing a road at an arbitrary location may not always be safe or legal. Due to these reasons, the idea of inserting virtual paths was discarded.

The final solution takes another approach. In the DRN dataset, bike paths are marked for travel in one direction or two directions. Here, the error source for detours is often the restricted one-way travel direction along the bike path. In cases where detours are observed due to long paths down the street until the next road crossing, it is likely that a similar road crossing lies closer up the street. Thus, a solution is to allow opposite-direction one-way travel on foot. This solution assumes that the bike can safely and legally be dismounted and walked in the opposite direction.

Having addressed the issues of duplicated nodes and detours due to non-crossable roads, no further issues have presented themselves. Thus, we can now focus on the merging of both datasets along the city border. The conflation process starts with matching the OpenStreetMap paths to the associated DRN paths along the city border. First, DRN nodes close (<20m) to the border are fetched. For each of these DRN nodes, the five nearest OpenStreetMap paths are treated as a possible match. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-drn-osm-border.pdf}
\caption{.}
\label{fig:routing-drn-osm-border}
\end{figure}

However, the OpenStreetMap paths may traverse the city border without a node lying exactly on the border geometry, potentially leading to z-shaped connections between OpenStreetMap and DRN. To avoid this problem, the conflation process inserts artificial OpenStreetMap nodes at the intersection of the city border geometry. These additional nodes are illustrated in \Cref{fig:routing-drn-osm-border} as helper points. Finally, for each DRN node, the nearest interpolated OpenStreetMap node is selected and connected. This process is highlighted in \Cref{fig:routing-drn-osm-border}, transitioning the DRN network over its original boundary into OpenStreetMap geometries, which can be clearly seen in the example.

After the geometric harmonization is finished and all DRN path tags are converted into the OpenStreetMap format, the path network is exported in the \texttt{.osm} format. This step finishes the overall merging process, delivering a map file that can be loaded by any routing engine that supports the OpenStreetMap format. All described steps are performed fully automatically in a single processing pipeline, allowing daily updates to the routing foundation without human intervention in the merging process. This allows changes to the cycling infrastructure to be reflected timely in the routing service, assuming the dataset provider updates DRN on a regular basis. 

Additional changes resulting from quality assurance to the existing paths are also automatically imported. During the process of testing the DRN routing, four issues with missing path geometries in the path network were encountered and reported via an e-mail address described on the dataset download page, leading to correction and response within one day by the dataset maintainers. Two additional geometries we initially interpreted as missing based on satellite images were apparently correct due to ongoing construction on site. Thus, if issues are encountered during usage of the integrated network, the quality assurance process can be considered timely overall, while proposed changes appear to be cross-checked.

\subsection{Integration}

So far, we have investigated how to establish a routing foundation based on the DRN dataset. However, the routing foundation itself is only one part of delivering accurate bike routes to users. Integrating this routing foundation as a service into the bike-GLOSA application requires a few additional steps. First, the routing foundation must be incorporated into a routing engine and deployed in a backend service. Afterward, specific routing profiles must be selected that enable personalized bike routing. Leveraging the inclination sensitivity of bike routing profiles necessitates selecting a suitable height provider. Finally, the routing can be applied inside the mobile application for distance-to-signal estimation and GNSS error correction. The end of this section discusses the employed rerouting strategy to ensure that users can still properly reach their destination even when deviating from the originally planned route.

\subsubsection{Automated Deployment}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/load-distribution-containerization-preheating.pdf}
\caption{CI/CD pipeline for automated rollouts of routing network updates.}
\label{fig:multi-stage-continuous-deployment}
\end{figure}

As a routing engine, we will choose the state-of-the-art solution GraphHopper that we have referenced in the related work section. GraphHopper is not only open source, it also provides access to community-tested bike routing profiles that we will reuse for route personalization. In addition, GraphHopper is also compatible with various height data providers and implements inclination-sensitive routing profiles. 

Using the \texttt{.osm} format, we can simply configure GraphHopper to load our DRN routing. Then, the GraphHopper service is packaged together with the DRN routing data into a Docker image and deployed on our Docker Swarm backend. Through the pipeline highlighted in \Cref{fig:multi-stage-continuous-deployment}, we configure a nightly build of the Docker image, including fetching and merging the current DRN data. An update executor on the orchestrator machine notices the updated Docker image and replaces the currently deployed service using a rolling update, ensuring that the running services always work with the newest map materials. 

Since GraphHopper requires time to preprocess the routing network on the first startup, the container startup is not immediate after it is rolled out to one of the replicated worker machines. Thus, allowing direct access to the starting routing engine could result in requests from clients failing. Two measures are employed to circumvent this issue. First, Traefik\footnote{\url{https://traefik.io/traefik/}} is utilized as a frontline proxy for the Docker Swarm and configured to direct only requests to healthy containers. A health check is implemented on the routing Docker container, allowing requests only once the container is started up. Additionally, to further accelerate the startup of each routing service container, the Docker image is preheated. Starting up GraphHopper during the build process and waiting for its routing API to become available makes the routing engine available faster after rollout. 

\subsubsection{Inclination-Sensitive and Personalizable Routing}

When deployed, GraphHopper provides different \texttt{vehicle}s with individual path weights depending on the road's properties. Each \texttt{vehicle} represents a different routing profile. Among these \texttt{vehicle}s are also various bike types such as \texttt{bike}, \texttt{bike2} (avoids inclines), \texttt{racingbike} or \texttt{mountainbike}. These profiles can be provided to the routing API to select a specific behavior, such as avoiding unpaved sections with the \texttt{racingbike} profile. However, one challenge is selecting the best routing configuration for a user's needs. 

Initially, the idea existed to infer the best routing profile, or even a custom routing profile, based on the user's recorded trajectories. However, this idea was discarded in favor of a much simpler and more robust approach, avoiding the danger of overemphasizing user data and providing inconsistent routes between multiple devices with the same configuration. Instead, users are given a menu as depicted in \Cref{fig:routing-profile-mapping} providing three options: bike type, route preference (fast, comfortable), and whether inclines should be avoided. Using these selections, a suitable routing profile is mapped. This allows two users to share and ride the same route together without any further issues.

Here, it should be noted that a short routing option was also provided preliminarily, in addition to fast and comfortable routing. However, routes generated with this routing profile would frequently lead over the wrong roadside since both roadsides are captured independently in DRN. The ported DRN network is configured with walking speeds in the opposite allowed direction, assuming users have to dismount their bicycles to correspond to road laws. As a result, another issue with routing on the opposite roadside was that travel times were increased significantly, reported as a bug by test users. Hence, the short routing profile was excluded from the available options. The other routing profiles do not have this problem since they also consider the travel time that is significantly increased traveling in the opposite direction.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-profile-mapping.pdf}
\caption{Mapping of routing profiles for route personalization.}
\label{fig:routing-profile-mapping}
\end{figure}

In case users don't specify a routing profile, a default routing profile (\texttt{bike2}) is selected that utilizes the \texttt{short\_fastest} weighting, which represents a compromise between the short and fast weightings. This routing profile also tends to avoid inclines, incorporating height data into the route-finding process.

In Hamburg, inclinations may be less of a concern, but there are still several roads with non-negligible inclines, such as Helgoländer Allee. To supplement the routing engine with the necessary height data that is not provided by DRN (or OpenStreetMap), there are multiple digital elevation models that can be used. By default, GraphHopper supports SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) \cite{farr_shuttle_2000, farr_shuttle_2007} and CGIAR \cite{jarvis_hole_2008} height data. The CGIAR height data is a proprietary post-processed version of the SRTM data, filling in data gaps in the SRTM height map, and is available under license to all GraphHopper users. By default, the routing engine is specified to use the SRTM dataset.

SRTM-1 offers a horizontal resolution of approximately 30m (1 arcsecond). For specific areas, additional SRTM X-SAR 25m data is provided by the DLR. For the covered regions of the SRTM X-SAR 25m model, the vertical precision is specified at $\pm$ 6m (relative vertical error at 90\% confidence level)\footnote{SRTM X-SAR 25m specification: \url{https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/dataguide/srtm/}}. An even higher precision is offered by the DGM-1 model for Hamburg, in which the one stands for one meter of horizontal resolution. In DGM-1, the vertical resolution is specified as $\pm$ 15cm\footnote{\url{https://metaver.de/trefferanzeige?docuuid=A39B4E86-15E2-4BF7-BA82-66F9913D5640}}. The high precision is reached by airborne laser scanning. Downscaled resolutions are available as DGM-10 (10m) and DGM-25 (25m).

To evaluate if the DGM models provide an overall better height profile than SRTM, cross-sections of the height models were analyzed by Max Lorenz. Another important question was how much resources the model consumes when loaded into the routing engine. The results indicated that the best tradeoff between resource usage and model accuracy is provided by the DGM-10 model. Thus, the DGM-10 model was integrated as the final digital elevation model into the GraphHopper routing engine using a custom tileset download and parsing plugin. The result is a GraphHopper routing engine that not only runs on the DRN dataset but also utilizes the DGM-10 model to provide accurate, personalized routing while consuming an acceptable amount of resources. 

\subsubsection{Distance-to-Signal Estimation and Mitigating GNSS Inaccuracies}

Focusing further on the applications of the developed routing engine within our GLOSA application, a distance estimation method was designed that aims to be more accurate than just taking the direct (linear) distance to the user's position. This method assumes that the route closely aligns with the actual bike infrastructure, ensuring an accurate estimation.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/distance-to-signal-estimation.pdf}
\caption{Distance-to-signal estimation along the route curvature for speed recommendation.}
\label{fig:distance-to-signal-estimation}
\end{figure}

The specific process is highlighted in \Cref{fig:distance-to-signal-estimation}. First, the user's location is snapped to the route geometry, and the subsequent route segments are traversed until reaching the snapped location of the upcoming traffic light. The locations of each traffic light are annotated to the route geometry using the traffic light matching method developed in \Cref{ch:matching}.

Along the precalculated route segments, the distance is determined using the Vincenty estimator, which provides a more accurate distance measure than the haversine distance through a more accurate representation of the earth's shape while being slightly more computationally expensive. To further optimize the computational overhead, the distances to each traffic light are precalculated along each route segment. With this approach, it is only necessary to calculate the distance along the current segment and then add this segment's distance to the next traffic light. The distance estimation process is repeated dynamically each time a new user location is received, updating the current speed advisory.

A second application of the route geometry within the app is for GNSS error correction, which arose not only as one of the major challenges for GLOSA applications in related work but also during preliminary experiments of the mobile app. Tests conducted in Dresden indicated that older devices (Android 6) struggle more with GNSS drift than newer devices. Even the latest generation of Android and iOS smartphones, configured to provide the highest level of geolocation accuracy, seem to experience this problem.

Assuming that the user strictly follows a predefined route, we can simply snap the user's location to the route, eliminating any GNSS scattering orthogonal to the route. GNSS scattering in the direction of the route is not eliminated. Thus, route snapping alone has the drawback that, when approaching a traffic light slowly, the measured location may jump beyond the traffic light with respect to the route. 

To mitigate this problem, GNSS drift at an intersection is detected as follows: if the user is moving at a GNSS speed less than 2 meters per second, the app reverts to the last traffic light if it is within 10 meters of the user and no other traffic light is closer. In case a traffic light is still overshot, the user also has the option to manually switch between traffic lights through the application's user interface. In case a user fully deviates from the designated route, automated rerouting is performed. Here, it is important to avoid triggering rerouting for minor GNSS errors when the user is still following the route accurately.

\subsubsection{Automated Rerouting}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/rerouting-strategy.pdf}
\caption{Schema of the rerouting procedure using a triggering threshold of 50 meters from the route.}
\label{fig:rerouting-strategy}
\end{figure}

The developed rerouting approach operates as illustrated in \Cref{fig:rerouting-strategy}: while the user is on the move, their location is continuously compared to the route by aligning it with the route geometry. The distance between the aligned location and the actual location is measured against a threshold. When the user moves significantly away from the route, exceeding the threshold, the rerouting is automatically initiated. 

A challenge in this approach is determining the appropriate distance threshold that strikes a balance between prompt rerouting and avoiding unnecessary recalculations. In initial tests conducted in Hamburg, a threshold of 20 meters was used. However, it proved to be too low and resulted in excessive unnecessary reroutings during field tests. Consequently, the threshold was increased to 50 meters, which yielded a satisfactory balance.

\end{tabular}
}
\caption{Schematic comparison of the initial and final rerouting algorithms.}
\label{fig:rerouting-strategy-comparison}
\end{figure}

An additional challenge in this approach is identifying the waypoints that have already been visited to prevent rerouting back to the starting point. To address this issue, only the remaining waypoints are selected when rerouting is triggered. Originally, the rerouting process involved selecting the nearest waypoint to the user and recalculating the route using that waypoint as a reference. However, this method depicted in \Cref{fig:rerouting-strategy-comparison} on the left was only effective half of the time, assuming the user's location was closer to the upcoming waypoint than to the previously visited waypoint. Consequently, this initial strategy often led to unnecessary backtracking.

Another option considered was snapping the user's location to the route geometry and following that path to find the next waypoint. However, a challenge arose because the waypoints were not directly integrated into the route geometry data structure, which is returned from the routing framework. Although it is possible to align the waypoints with the route geometry for implementation, a simpler and faster approximation was employed in the app, consisting of three steps: (1) Drawing direct lines between waypoints to create a connected path roughly resembling the route. (2) Selecting the nearest line to the user's location. (3) Determining the waypoint at the end of this line as the next waypoint for recalculating the route. This approach assumes that the drawn lines approximately represent the general route structure.
