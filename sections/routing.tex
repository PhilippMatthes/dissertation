\section{Introduction}

The mobility behavior in urban environments is becoming increasingly intermodal. The trend is moving towards multimodal mobility planning \cite{park_framework_2023}, where bike-sharing and bike routes also play a significant role. Understanding cyclists' behaviors, particularly their route choices, is crucial not only for calculating preferences for suitable cycling routes but also as a fundamental aspect of expanding cycling infrastructure and urban planning \cite{zielstra_comparative_2011, huber_modelling_2021}. Models that replicate cyclists' route choices provide immediate insights into where cycling infrastructure should receive high priority. Thus, the application scenarios of bike routing are versatile and not strictly limited to navigation solutions.

To generate accurate routes for cyclists, one of the main challenges lies in the high individuality and context dependence of chosen paths \cite{dill_revisiting_2016, schleinitz_german_2017, misra_modeling_2018}, in which a multitude of criteria influence the optimal route \cite{song_exploring_2014, arellana_developing_2020}. The grade of infrastructure separation, varying surface conditions, and personal preferences play a significant role in route choices \cite{hardinghaus_attractive_2022}. Spontaneous deviations also play a role, requiring appropriate rerouting.

In the context of GLOSA applications, routing is linked to additional factors. Here, an accurate alignment of the bike route with actual cycling infrastructure plays a significant role in precisely determining upcoming traffic lights. Accounting for bends or obstacles on the way to the traffic light ensures accurate distance estimation, preventing the speed recommendation from deviating from the actual speed. Additionally, factors such as route incline and road conditions may impact a user's ability to follow given speed advisories, in addition to their influence on route choice. Accurate and consistent meta-information is desirable in these cases and can be obtained from an open or commercial routing foundation.

Many aspects have to be considered when choosing a routing provider. Among these are global coverage, transparency, extensibility, copyright, privacy, costs, and vendor lock-ins. Providing a good balance between all of these aspects, various acknowledged routing apps, such as Openrouteservice\footnote{\url{https://openrouteservice.org/}}, Photon and Komoot\footnote{\url{https://photon.komoot.io/}}, and Mapbox\footnote{\url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapbox}}, resort to OpenStreetMap routing. Apple Maps and Bing Maps also use OpenStreetMap wherever no commercial data providers are available\footnote{\url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Apple}, \url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bing_Maps}}. 

Despite being an established and recognized map foundation, an ongoing issue is that Open\allowbreak Street\allowbreak Map's accuracy and consistency are not always as high as desired. Due to its Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) concept \cite{wasserman_evaluating_2019, jacobs_openstreetmap_2020, vybornova_automated_2023}, people with varying levels of expertise and preferences contribute to the map foundation. With a highly engaged user base and various company-level contributors, OpenStreetMap profits from frequent updates. However, similar to Wikipedia, not all contributions are of high quality. As a result, bike paths are not always captured as separate geometries from the road or tagged with the correct properties. Consequently, bike routes generated with OpenStreetMap are subject to imperfections and routing errors. A more accurate bike routing foundation may be desirable for many use cases, such as in our work.

The goal of this chapter is to investigate another potential bike routing foundation: map datasets that have been created and are maintained by local authorities, so-called authoritative datasets. Such datasets usually convey a higher level of quality assurance and overall correctness \cite{brovelli_towards_2017}. In Hamburg, we found the authoritative dataset "Digitales Radnetz Hamburg" (Digital Cycling Network Hamburg, DRN)\footnote{\url{https://metaver.de/trefferanzeige?docuuid=EA847D9F-6403-4B75-BCDB-73F831F960C7}}, which is publicly available and contains all bike paths in the city. The goal of this chapter is to investigate whether such datasets may provide a more accurate bike routing foundation and, if so, to what extent the routing can be improved. Ideally, our methods for processing the dataset could then be reused for other cities for applications that need a more accurate routing.

One issue of authoritative datasets is their spatial limitedness to a specific region. In the case of DRN, it is restricted to the city of Hamburg, making routing across city borders and patchworking with other datasets challenging. In this chapter, we will investigate a potential solution for this problem, cutting out the regions supported by DRN from OpenStreetMap and stitching both datasets along the boundary. As a result, we obtain a hybrid bike routing network on which the process could be repeated for other cities. After generating our hybrid routing foundation, we will investigate the routing foundation's integration in our bike-GLOSA app. This includes a study of elevation providers for route personalization, investigating distance-to-signal estimation, developing a method for rerouting, and updating the map material regularly.

A key focus is whether the developed solution can improve traffic light matching, compared to results from \Cref{ch:matching}. Among other quality metrics, we will compare alignment with the actual positions of cycling infrastructure and the number of routing errors with OpenStreetMap. Other routing providers like Bing Maps or Google Maps will also be tested. Based on these results, we conclude whether routing on authoritative datasets should be investigated further or if OpenStreetMap can already be considered the best option for bike routing.

\section{Related Work}

Establishing an accurate bike routing is a multifaceted research area. One avenue of investigation focuses on models that can predict cyclists' route choices with high accuracy based on available metadata \cite{dill_understanding_2008, ghanayim_modelling_2018, huber_modelling_2021}. This involves correlating GNSS trajectories with routing networks to understand the relationships between path characteristics and route selection \cite{sultan_extracting_2017, huber_modelling_2021}. Some studies also focus on safe bike routing \cite{loidl_online_2018}, popularity-based routing \cite{bergman_conflation_2016} or the short-term effects of infrastructure changes on cyclists' route preferences \cite{yeboah_route_2015, pritchard_does_2019}. Over the years, open-source routing engines such as GraphHopper\footnote{\url{https://www.graphhopper.com/}} have continuously improved, providing community- and research-tested routing profiles tailored for various types of cycling \cite{krismer_elevation_2016}. Thus, although research around understanding cyclist route choices is ongoing, available route choice models can already be considered quite advanced and consolidated.

As Huber et al. (2021) \cite{huber_modelling_2021} have demonstrated, achieving a high level of accuracy in bike route choice prediction is strongly tied to having highly consistent meta-information about inclination, bike path type, surface quality, and also speed limits of surrounding motorized traffic. Using these attributes as additional decision criteria to route distance, the authors could model bike routing decisions with an accuracy of 88.6\% relative to GNSS trajectories. Thus, there is still room for improvement. However, route choice models are naturally limited to the consistency of such meta-information within the utilized map material, not only the overall completeness and accuracy of the depicted bike paths.

Consequently, bike routing decision models highly depend on enhancements in the accuracy and consistency of routing foundations. In the following sections, we will investigate the status quo and which potentials for map improvement are currently under investigation. Specifically, we will investigate related works that utilize external authoritative datasets to improve bike path segments' overall quality and alignment. Subsequently, we will delve into several challenges for GLOSA systems where precise routing emerges as a key solution.

\subsection{Bike Path Consistency and Accuracy in Routing Foundations}

How accurately and consistently a bike routing can be performed depends on the specific kind of routing foundation: VGIs such as OpenStreetMap, commercial providers such as Google Maps or Bing Maps, or authoritative infrastructure datasets.

Which routing foundation is best among multiple options is not a question that can be quickly answered. Comparative research indicates that Google Maps and Bing Maps do not necessarily provide a more consistent and accurate depiction than OpenStreetMap. Ciepluch's early investigation in 2010 \cite{ciepluch_comparison_2010} revealed that Google Maps, Bing Maps, and OpenStreetMap did not significantly differ in quality, with no platform emerging as a clear winner, while notable variations between cities could be identified. Of course, these results need to be seen in a time context and may not be valid anymore. 

However, recent studies have come to similar findings. Franzini et al. (2020) \cite{franzini_assessment_2020} found that only 40\% of Italy's Pavia region is fully mapped in OpenStreetMap and 30\% in Google Maps, based on 2018 data. In other cities, the situation is considerably more favorable. Hochmair et al. (2015) \cite{hochmair_assessing_2015}, explicitly assessing the coverage of bicycle infrastructure, found Portland to cover 86.4\% of 26 km of bicycle trails in OpenStreetMap and 78.4\% in Google Maps. This result stands in significant contrast to the reported numbers for Miami, where only 22.8\% (OpenStreetMap) and 36.5\% (Google Maps) of 22 km of reference paths were accurately recorded, with a significant omission of paths along recreational sites such as rivers and parks. Thus, some cities require more substantial improvements to the mapping quality than others. The differences in mapping completeness between cities can be substantial.

There are also systematic issues that are not bound to specific cities. Ferster et al. (2019) \cite{ferster_using_2019} and Wasserman et al. (2019) \cite{wasserman_evaluating_2019} highlighted inconsistencies in meta-information about bike path quality in OpenStreetMap, impacting the determination of bikeability. Vybornova et al. (2023) \cite{vybornova_automated_2023} demonstrated that connectivity issues in bicycle path segments could disrupt meaningful route calculations. These disconnected bike path segments may arise from false editations to the map material.

Multiple solutions that focus on flagging these issues for manual correction have been proposed. In this course, authoritative datasets have been used as ground truths to identify issues, as demonstrated by various studies \cite{haklay_how_2010, jokar_arsanjani_quality_2015, ludwig_comparison_2011}. Brovelli et al. (2017) \cite{brovelli_towards_2017} introduced a framework for comparing open reference map data with OpenStreetMap, focusing on enhanced reusability. In their work, the authors propose specific metrics that can be utilized to identify city areas in which the mapping quality is deficient.

Apart from flagging and quality-assurance helpers, there are also works that investigate automated error correction solutions. For example, Vybornova et al. (2023) \cite{vybornova_automated_2023} recently suggested a method to detect and rectify missing connections between bike paths. Nasiri et al. (2018) \cite{nasiri_improving_2018} introduced a multi-stage approach in which outliers are detected and removed from OpenStreetMap edit histories, improving the positional precision of features by 14\% in Teheran.  

Authoritative datasets have been investigated to fill in missing or inconsistent path metadata by combining paths from the authoritative dataset to the OpenStreetMap network. Both Szwoch (2018) \cite{szwoch_combining_2019} and Fan et al. (2016) \cite{fan_polygon-based_2016} examine map-matching methods that have established themselves as a valuable tool to bridge topological differences between slightly offset map sources \cite{chao_survey_2020}. In a recent study, Meister et al. (2023) \cite{meister_route_2023} investigated cyclists' route choices in Zurich, using map-matching to incorporate metadata from a municipal dataset due to OpenStreetMap's insufficient consistency. The geometrical precision of OpenStreetMap bike path segments was not enhanced.

Two studies also employ a geometric modification to the path network. Smarzaro et al. (2021) \cite{smarzaro_creation_2021} investigated such an approach to reach a higher path coverage for multimodal routing. Their method involves comparing geospatial features from external datasets to nearby paths, adding new features if they do not overlap with existing ones. Li et al. (2017) \cite{li_optimized_2017} demonstrate the integration of OpenStreetMap into an authoritative bikeway dataset to primarily enhance coverage. Their semi-automated approach involves preprocessing datasets, an automatic conflation that maps metadata between formats, and human-in-the-loop adjustments to evaluate matching quality. 

Both studies convey promising methods, although no specific evaluation with ground truth, i.e., the actual position of bike paths, is presented. More investigation is required to investigate the impacts of such a routing on general routing errors, alignment with bike paths, and the impacts of routing on traffic light matching as a crucial functionality for GLOSA applications.

\subsection{Routing in GLOSA Applications}

Building on the collected understanding of general challenges in routing, we will now focus on ongoing challenges in GLOSA applications that are directly or indirectly related to routing.

In a study by Sharara et al. (2019) \cite{sharara_impact_2019}, it has been shown that drivers need a considerable amount of time to adapt to the speed advisory. A critical factor for a timely speed advisory activation is detecting which traffic light will be passed as early as possible during the ride. 

As one possible solution, Mahler et al. (2012) \cite{mahler_reducing_2012} proposed using Google Maps to generate a route, selecting traffic lights even before the ride has started. As we have shown in \Cref{ch:matching}, most current approaches to select traffic lights are based on snapping the user location to the nearest traffic light geometry \cite{katsaros_performance_2011, bernais_design_2016, wilson_driver_2017, stahlmann_exploring_2018, bhattacharyya_assessing_2022}, not considering the predicted turns or general trajectory of the user. This leads to the issue that most current approaches delay the speed advisory's activation until a sufficient match can be determined. Sometimes, the speed advisory may be hidden from the user even close to the traffic light due to a missing match \cite{wilson_driver_2017, stahlmann_exploring_2018}.

In our work (2022 -- 2023) \cite{matthes2022matching, matthes2023geo}, we developed a matching procedure bringing the approach envisioned by Mahler et al. (2012) \cite{mahler_reducing_2012} into practice. Finding errors in the generated OpenStreetMap bike routes, the developed model was designed robustly to circumvent routing errors and inaccuracies. Nonetheless, it was determined that attaining more accurate bike routes could benefit the described approach and provide a more accurate matching.

Another ongoing challenge is the practicality of multi-segment GLOSA. Proposed by Seredynski et al. (2013) \cite{seredynski_comparison_2013, seredynski_multi-segment_2013}, the idea of such systems is calculating an optimal speed for multiple consecutive traffic lights instead of only one, further decreasing the energy consumption of a vehicle. This method was further investigated by Xu et al. (2015) \cite{xu_bb_2015}, De Nunzio et al. (2015) \cite{de_nunzio_eco-driving_2015}, Nguyen et al. (2016) \cite{nguyen_efficient_2016}, and Simchon et al. (2020) \cite{simchon_real-time_2020}. 

In the previously mentioned analysis by Sharara et al. (2019) \cite{sharara_impact_2019}, a multi-segment GLOSA approach was found to be more robust against poor network performance. Nonetheless, at the moment, this idea has not been tested outside of simulations or controlled test beds. Mellegård et al. (2020) \cite{mellegard_day_2020} consider predicting multiple consecutive intersections in a realistic environment an ongoing challenge in GLOSA systems. Route-based matching may be the key solution needed to enable this approach in the real world.

Strongly tied to accurate routing is also the task of distance-to-signal estimation. A precise estimate is required for all GLOSA applications that provide a direct speed advisory to the user. The distance influences the time the user is predicted to arrive at the intersection with the current speed and, thus, the speed advisory as well. However, many studies neglect the opportunity to address this aspect in more detail, assuming that a straight-line distance between the user location and the traffic light is sufficiently accurate \cite{iglesias_i2v_2008, katsaros_performance_2011, koukoumidis_signalguru_2011, koukoumidis_leveraging_2012, krause_traffic_2012, li_open_2012, stevanovic_green_2013, eckhoff_potentials_2013, tal_vehicular-communications-based_2016, bernais_design_2016, stebbins_characterising_2017, sharara_impact_2019}. 

Only two studies suggest a different method for distance-to-signal estimation. In a study by Hao et al. (2019) \cite{hao_eco-approach_2019}, a map-matching algorithm is mentioned that positions the vehicle on its predefined trajectory along the test traffic lights. Xie et al. (2021) \cite{xie_dynamic_2021} utilize a predefined bus route to calculate the distance to the next intersection. These approaches could enhance the distance estimation in the presence of an accurate routing, also providing the potential to rectify the issue of GNSS inaccuracies. However, so far, these aspects have only been addressed superficially.

Finally, context adaptivity is another area for improvement in which routing may play a considerable role. As discussed by Fickas et al. (2019) \cite{fickas_fast_2019}, cyclist applications of GLOSA demand a speed advisory to be given sensitively. Other studies by Tal et al. (2016) \cite{tal_vehicular-communications-based_2016} and Dabiri et al. (2020) \cite{dabiri_optimized_2020} conducted on cyclists investigate wind speeds as the main influencing factor for a speed advisory system. However, the bike path surface quality also plays a prominent role in bikeability \cite{wasserman_evaluating_2019} in addition to the path inclination, which has been studied as an influencing factor in studies on cars as well \cite{zhang_green_2020}. The necessary information could be acquired using a routing system, opening up new possibilities for a sensible speed advisory.

\begin{Summary}[Summary of Research Gap]
The main area for improving bike routing is bike map accuracy. It is widely acknowledged that the depiction of bike paths in OpenStreetMap and competitors such as Google Maps or Bing Maps is often not ideal. Authoritative map material is often used as a ground truth to detect errors in the map foundations. However, only a few studies investigate how authoritative maps could be utilized directly to improve a routing foundation's quality and what a potential improvement means for the GLOSA application's quality of service.

Apart from utilizing map matching to gather more consistent metadata from the authoritative maps, two studies have focused on hybridizing VGIs with authoritative datasets, providing promising outlooks for the idea of routing on authoritative data. Instead of merging entire regions, these works have focused on merging individual paths. A more thorough investigation of the gainable accuracy relative to actual cycling infrastructure and intersection topologies is also required. Since there is a large variety of authoritative datasets, not all may have a common format or quality, limiting the reusability of the developed concepts.

Second, routing provides various new avenues for GLOSA research but has not been seen as an integral component thus far. Current approaches for traffic light matching lack consideration for predicted turns and user trajectory, resulting in delayed or non-activation of speed advisories. Route-based approaches, seen as enablers for multi-segment GLOSA systems, require more accurate bike routes to enhance traffic light matching accuracy. Distance-to-signal estimation is often oversimplified, with limited studies exploring alternatives to straight-line distance calculations. The potential of routing to address GNSS inaccuracies and improve distance estimation is generally underexplored in GLOSA studies. 

Lastly, the context adaptivity of GLOSA systems for cyclists, considering factors like path surface quality and inclination, remains another area for improvement. Through delivering inclination and surface information, routing systems could play a pivotal role in acquiring necessary information for a more sensitive and tailored speed advisory, presenting an avenue for future research and development.
\end{Summary}

\section{Concept}

The concept aims to address the described research gaps in two ways. First, we develop a concept for substituting regions in OpenStreetMap with a patch obtained from our authoritative dataset, DRN. Focusing on the reusability of our concept, this substitution may then be repeated for other regions, ultimately obtaining a patchwork of accurate routing networks. To scale our approach, we focus on automating every step in the processing pipeline through error-correction methods without human intervention. As a result, we obtain a hybrid routing network that can be inserted into practically every routing engine that supports the existing OpenStreetMap format.

In the second part of our concept, we focus on the routing's integration into our bike-GLOSA app. Using the full automatability of our concept, we develop an integration pipeline that delivers day-accurate map materials to the app's users. We discuss how route personalization is realized and which digital elevation model is selected to provide inclination-sensitive routing. Afterward, we address the described scarcity in investigations of distance-to-signal estimation by discussing our concrete method in more detail, including the role of routing in our GNSS error correction. To complete the picture, we will briefly examine our method for automated rerouting.

\subsection{DRN Routing}\label{sec:lorenz1}

The DRN dataset is an authoritative routing network for Hamburg, designed explicitly for bicycle paths. Published by the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, Behörde für Verkehr und Mobilitätswende (BVM), it is made available under the DL-DE BY-2.0\footnote{\url{https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/by-2-0}} license. The dataset undergoes continuous updates and is currently in production as of 2023. Users can access the dataset through a public interface at no cost. 

Distinguished by its routing capability, the dataset encompasses interconnected segments forming a graph, including roads designated for cyclists when dedicated bike paths are unavailable. Covering the entire area of Hamburg, it is possible to replace this area from OpenStreetMap with DRN data. Nevertheless, there are disparities between the two datasets that necessitate overcoming. The following sections outline the necessary processing steps to develop a DRN-based routing. These sections are based on the steps developed under supervision in Max Lorenz's Diploma thesis \cite{lorenz_2022}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-drn-osm-intersection.pdf}
\caption{Alignment of OpenStreetMap vs. DRN with the intersection topology. Depicted are traffic light geometries for cyclists on Millerntorplatz in Hamburg, as well as both routing network topologies. DRN shows fewer paths in total, but the bike paths align better with the bike traffic light geometries.}
\label{fig:comparison}
\end{figure}

First, the DRN specification poses a challenge, requiring a meaningful mapping of DRN's numerous custom path categories to the OpenStreetMap format. Additionally, the geometry of DRN differs from that of OpenStreetMap. Looking at \Cref{fig:comparison} to obtain an initial view of the differences between both datasets, bike paths are usually mapped as separate geometries, generally aligning better with traffic light geometries (denoted in red). However, some secondary paths or roads not intended for cyclists are absent in DRN, requiring additional attention.

An area where the geometric discrepancy becomes problematic is the boundary between both datasets, demarcated by Hamburg's city border. A meaningful connection between the path segments must be established to support cross-border routing, considering no one-to-one matching may be possible between paths in both networks. To address this challenge, a stitching procedure will be employed. However, as subsequent sections will reveal, we will face more routing issues due to the unique geometric properties of the DRN dataset. These will also be addressed to obtain a geometrically harmonized hybrid routing foundation. 

Our final routing foundation will be established once metadata and geometric structures are harmonized. This foundation will enable routing within Hamburg using the DRN dataset and beyond its borders on OpenStreetMap.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-drn.pdf}
\caption{An overview of the DRN dataset and its bike path types, as of December 23, 2023. Seen here is also the border of the authoritative routing foundation. The top six path types and surface types by the number of path segments are highlighted by different colors. The number of path segments is also given in the legend.}
\label{fig:drn-map}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Metadata Harmonization}\label{sec:maxlorenz1}

A zoomed-out perspective on the DRN dataset is given in \Cref{fig:drn-map}. The dataset can be downloaded as CSV, GeoJSON, or GML. These formats are typical for geodata but require additional processing to translate into the specialized \texttt{.osm} format, in which path geometries are given with specific OpenStreetMap attributes. The \texttt{.osm} format allows routing engines to understand bike surface properties and weigh them accordingly through bike-tailored routing profiles.  

Thus, to establish a conversion process from DRN to the \texttt{.osm} format, not only the geometries have to be transformed. As we have seen in our literature study, providing the most accurate routing possible requires converting path properties as well. Among others, the following properties are mapped\footnote{The displayed statistics represent a snapshot of December 27, 2023.}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Direction of travel (49813 segments bidirectional and 47606 segments unidirectional)
    \item Time restrictions (32 segments affected)
    \item Temporary paths such as pop-up lanes or detours (83 segments affected)
    \item If a segment is associated with a specific velo route or designated bike tours (Freizeitroute)
    \item Level (96237 flat, 1121 across bridges, 186 through tunnels)
    \item Obstacles (456 impassable, 52 can be circumvented, e.g., via footpath)
    \item The type of bike path and its surface, as illustrated in \Cref{fig:drn-map}
    \item Target and end node ID of the segment connecting the segments to a graph
    \item The segment's coordinates
\end{itemize}

These properties are utilized to infer a corresponding OpenStreetMap class, transforming the DRN dataset into the OpenStreetMap format. This approach of format harmonization lays the foundation for merging both datasets at the city border. Another benefit is that it allows us to reuse existing OpenStreetMap data loaders for routing engines without writing a custom plugin.

The challenge here is that no one-to-one match exists between all DRN properties and OpenStreetMap properties. For example, DRN specifies three types for compacted surface: "befestigt - nicht genauer erkennbar", "befestigt - zu detailieren" and "Wassergebundene Decke". To resolve this problem, a mapping was developed that assumes the OpenStreetMap tags from the DRN specification. 

\begin{table}[!t]

\caption{Full mapping of metadata from DRN to OSM. The OSM tags are given in the right four columns. The german name of the path type as contained in the DRN is highlighted in the left column. The bottom part of the table also shows the various surface mappings. The mapping is a modified version of the mapping developed in Max Lorenz's Diploma thesis \cite{lorenz_2022}.}\label{tab:tag-mapping}

\end{table}

The final mapping highlighted in \Cref{tab:tag-mapping} includes the bike path's surface, level, direction, and type. In cases where the bike path's properties cannot be directly mapped to a suitable OpenStreetMap tag, the path is tagged with \texttt{highway=tertiary}. This fallback corresponds to established mapping practices in Germany. The result is an inferred set of tags for each path in the OpenStreetMap format, completing the metadata harmonization process.

\subsubsection{Geometric Harmonization}\label{sec:maxlorenz2}

After the conversion of metadata, the second step is geometric harmonization. However, before we can merge both datasets, two issues still need further attention: detours resulting from duplicated nodes in the graph and detours because the road cannot be crossed. 

Each path in the DRN dataset starts and ends in a node, which must be transformed into OpenStreetMap nodes that connect the individual paths to a graph structure\footnote{\url{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node}}. To ease this process, the DRN dataset provides node IDs for each path's start and end points. Thus, two OpenStreetMap nodes need to be generated for each DRN path based on the start and end coordinates given in the line geometry. 

Since multiple DRN paths may be connected to a single OpenStreetMap node, the same node is generated multiple times during dataset processing. Theoretically, this should not be a problem since the node ID should avoid duplicates. In practice, however, sometimes there are nodes for which multiple different coordinates are found in the dataset, presumably due to floating point inaccuracies of a preceding geographic projection step during dataset publishing. As highlighted in \Cref{fig:node-merging}, this leads to the issue of duplicated OpenStreetMap nodes in the proximity of a few centimeters that are not correctly connected.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/node-merging.pdf}
\caption{Illustration of duplicated nodes (black circles) that lead to a detour in the route (red). On the right, the duplicated nodes (left) were merged (right) to avoid detours. Source: \cite{lorenz_2022}}
\label{fig:node-merging}
\end{figure}

The developed solution involves merging all found coordinates for a specific node ID into a center point. Let $C_k = \{c_{k_1} = (lat_{k_1}, lng_{k_1}), \text{...} , c_{k_n} = (lat_{k_n}, lng_{k_n})\}$ be the collected coordinates for each node $k$. Then, the center point $\text{Center}_{\text{k}}$ is calculated as the mean of all coordinates for that node ID:

\begin{equation}\text{Center}_{\text{k}} = \left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|C_k|} \text{{lat}}_{k_i}}{|C_k|}, \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|C_k|} \text{{lng}}_{k_i}}{|C_k|}\right)\end{equation}

This method assumes small distances between the coordinates that are not noticeably affected by the curved WGS84 projection system. The maximum relocation distance between all $\text{Center}_{\text{k}}$ and $c \in C_k$ was calculated as 8.3 centimeters using the haversine formula. Based on this preliminary validation, no further points are falsely connected. Thus, this first issue could be resolved without further challenges or manual processing.

The second issue in the DRN dataset requiring additional processing is non-crossable roads, as highlighted in \Cref{fig:oneway-travel-fix}. Since bike paths on both roadsides are captured as individual geometries in the DRN dataset, there may be long road segments with bike paths running in parallel. However, without interconnections between the roadsides, the route cannot also cross the road. Sometimes, this represents a problem since side roads attached to the opposite roadside can only be reached by long detours. This is a lesser problem with OpenStreetMap since it often captures roads as a singular path running in the center of all lanes.\footnote{We can also learn something about OpenStreetMap here. Avoiding detours due to missing interconnections between both sides of the bike paths, as seen with DRN, may also be one additional reason why OpenStreetMap often maps the bike route onto the car lanes. Without the mapping onto the center of the road, the OpenStreetMap route may have to take a longer path.}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/oneway-travel-fix.pdf}
\caption{Example of a detour (left) that can be fixed by enabling opposite-direction one-way travel on foot (right), compared to OpenStreetMap route (blue). In the right example, the route traverses the road further upstream, applying a walking speed when traveling in the opposite direction. The OpenStreetMap route is calculated in the center of the road and thus does not have this problem. Source: \cite{lorenz_2022}}
\label{fig:oneway-travel-fix}
\end{figure}

One explored solution is the introduction of "virtual" paths connecting the roadsides. Using these paths, the route could traverse between roadsides and avoid detours. Although this concept may sound like a reasonable idea at first, the question is where to place these virtual paths. For example, one could place these paths in a fixed interval along a road between roadsides. However, there could always be a physical barrier between both roadsides, meaning that generated routes would guide users over impassable obstacles or potentially encourage dangerous maneuvers. Traversing a road at an arbitrary location may not always be safe or legal. Due to these reasons, the idea of inserting virtual paths was discarded.

The final solution takes another approach. In the DRN dataset, bike paths are marked for travel in one direction or two directions. Here, the error source for detours is often the restricted one-way travel direction along the bike path. In cases where detours are observed due to long paths down the street until the next road crossing, a similar road crossing often lies closer up the street. Thus, a solution is to allow opposite-direction one-way travel on foot. This solution assumes that the bike can safely and legally be dismounted and walked in the opposite direction.

Having addressed the issues of duplicated nodes and detours due to non-crossable roads, no further issues have presented themselves. Thus, we can now focus on merging both datasets along the city border. The conflation process starts with matching the OpenStreetMap paths to the associated DRN paths along the city border. First, DRN nodes close (<20m) to the border are fetched. The five nearest OpenStreetMap paths are treated as a possible match for each DRN node. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-drn-osm-border.pdf}
\caption{Example of stitching around the DRN dataset's border.}
\label{fig:routing-drn-osm-border}
\end{figure}

However, the OpenStreetMap paths may traverse the city border without a node located precisely on the border geometry, potentially leading to z-shaped connections between OpenStreetMap and DRN. To avoid this problem, the conflation process inserts artificial OpenStreetMap nodes at the intersection of the city border geometry. These additional nodes are illustrated as helper points in \Cref{fig:routing-drn-osm-border}. Finally, the nearest interpolated OpenStreetMap node is selected and connected for each DRN node. This process is highlighted in \Cref{fig:routing-drn-osm-border}, transitioning the DRN network over its original boundary into OpenStreetMap geometries, as seen in the example.

After the geometric harmonization is finished and all DRN path tags are converted into the OpenStreetMap format, the path network is exported in the \texttt{.osm} format. This step finishes the overall merging process, delivering a map file that can be loaded by any routing engine that supports this format. All described steps are performed automatically in a single processing pipeline, allowing daily updates to the routing foundation without human intervention in the merging process. This allows changes to the cycling infrastructure to be reflected promptly in the routing service, assuming the dataset provider updates DRN regularly as specified by the dataset's documentation. 

Additional changes resulting from quality assurance to the existing paths are also automatically imported. While testing the DRN routing, four issues with missing path geometries in the path network were encountered and reported via an e-mail address described on the dataset download page, leading to correction and response by the dataset maintainers within one day. Two additional geometries we initially interpreted as missing based on satellite images were correct due to ongoing construction on site. Thus, if issues are encountered during usage of the integrated network, the quality assurance process can be considered timely overall, while proposed changes appear to be cross-checked.

\subsection{Integration}

So far, we have investigated how to establish a routing foundation based on the DRN dataset. However, the routing foundation is only one part of delivering accurate bike routes to users. Integrating this routing foundation as a service into the bike-GLOSA application requires a few additional steps. First, the routing foundation must be incorporated into a routing engine and deployed in a backend service. Afterward, specific routing profiles that enable personalized bike routing must be selected. Leveraging the inclination sensitivity of bike routing profiles necessitates selecting a suitable height provider. Finally, the routing can be applied inside the mobile application for distance-to-signal estimation and GNSS error correction. The end of this section discusses the rerouting strategy employed to ensure that users can still correctly reach their destination even when deviating from the originally planned route.

\subsubsection{Automated Deployment}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/load-distribution-containerization-preheating.pdf}
\caption{CI/CD pipeline for automated rollouts of routing network updates.}
\label{fig:multi-stage-continuous-deployment}
\end{figure}

As a routing engine, we will choose the state-of-the-art solution GraphHopper that we have referenced in the related work section. GraphHopper is open-source and provides access to community-tested bike routing profiles that we will reuse for route personalization. In addition, GraphHopper is also compatible with various height data providers and implements inclination-sensitive routing profiles for cyclists. 

Using the \texttt{.osm} format, we can configure GraphHopper to load our DRN routing. Then, the GraphHopper service is packaged with the DRN routing data into a Docker image and deployed on our backend. Through the pipeline highlighted in \Cref{fig:multi-stage-continuous-deployment}, we configure a nightly Docker image build, including fetching and merging the current DRN data. An update executor on the deployment orchestrator machine notices the updated Docker image and replaces the currently deployed service using a rolling update, ensuring that the running services always work with the newest map materials. 

We also had to perform some tweaks to our deployment to ensure that the routing service operates as intended. Since GraphHopper requires time to preprocess the routing network on the first startup, the container startup is not immediate after it is rolled out to one of the replicated worker machines. Thus, allowing direct access to the starting routing engine could result in client requests failing. Two measures are employed to circumvent this issue. First, Traefik\footnote{\url{https://traefik.io/traefik/}} is utilized as a frontline proxy for the deployment and configured to direct only requests to healthy containers, as the NGINX\footnote{\url{https://nginx.org/en/}} proxy initially used had problems detecting healthy containers. A health check is implemented on the routing Docker container, allowing requests only once the container is started. Additionally, the Docker image is preheated further to accelerate the startup of each routing service container. Starting up GraphHopper during the build process and waiting for its routing API to become available makes the routing engine available faster after rollout.

\subsubsection{Inclination-Sensitive and Personalizable Routing}\label{sec:maxlorenz3}

When deployed, GraphHopper provides different \texttt{vehicle}s with individual path weights depending on the road's properties. Each \texttt{vehicle} represents a different routing profile. Among these \texttt{vehicle}s are also various bike types such as \texttt{bike}, \texttt{bike2} (avoids inclines), \texttt{racingbike} or \texttt{mountainbike}. The routing API provides these profiles to select a specific behavior, such as avoiding unpaved sections with the \texttt{racingbike} profile. However, one challenge is selecting the best routing configuration for a user's needs. 

Initially, the idea existed to infer the best routing profile, or even a custom routing profile, based on the user's recorded trajectories. However, this idea was discarded in favor of a less complex and more robust approach, avoiding the danger of overemphasizing user data and providing inconsistent routes between multiple devices with the same configuration. Instead, users are given a menu as depicted in \Cref{fig:routing-profile-mapping} providing three options: bike type, route preference (fast, comfortable), and whether inclines should be avoided. Using these selections, a suitable routing profile is mapped. This allows two users to share and ride the same route without further issues.

Here, a short routing option was also provided preliminarily, in addition to fast and comfortable routing. However, routes generated with this routing profile would frequently lead over the wrong roadside since both roadsides are captured independently in DRN. The ported DRN network is configured with walking speeds in the opposite allowed direction, assuming users have to dismount their bicycles to correspond to road laws. As a result, another issue with routing on the opposite roadside was that travel times increased significantly, which was reported as a bug by test users. Hence, the short routing profile was excluded from the available options. The other routing profiles do not have this problem since they also consider the travel time that significantly increases traveling in the opposite direction.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-profile-mapping.pdf}
\caption{Mapping of routing profiles for route personalization.}
\label{fig:routing-profile-mapping}
\end{figure}

In case users do not specify a routing profile, a default routing profile (\texttt{bike2}) is selected that utilizes the \texttt{short\_fastest} weighting, which represents a compromise between the short and fast weightings. This routing profile also avoids inclines, incorporating height data into the route-finding process.

In Hamburg, inclinations may be less of a concern, but there are still several roads with non-negligible inclines, such as Helgoländer Allee\footnote{\url{https://www.google.com/maps/place/Helgol\%C3\%A4nder+Allee,+Hamburg}}. Multiple digital elevation models can be used to supplement the routing engine with the necessary height data not provided by DRN (or OpenStreetMap). By default, GraphHopper supports SRTM \cite{farr_shuttle_2000, farr_shuttle_2007}, and CGIAR\footnote{\url{https://bigdata.cgiar.org/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database/}} height data. The CGIAR height data is a proprietary post-processed version of the SRTM data, filling in data gaps in the SRTM height map, and is available under license to all GraphHopper users. By default, the routing engine is specified to use the SRTM dataset.

SRTM-1 offers a horizontal resolution of approximately 30m (1 arcsecond). For specific areas, additional SRTM X-SAR 25m data is provided by the DLR\footnote{SRTM X-SAR 25m specification: \url{https://geoservice.dlr.de/web/dataguide/srtm/}}. For the covered regions of the SRTM X-SAR 25m model, the vertical precision is specified at $\pm$ 6m (relative vertical error at 90\% confidence level). The DGM-1 model for Hamburg offers an even higher precision, in which the one stands for one meter of horizontal resolution. In DGM-1, the vertical resolution is specified as $\pm$ 15cm\footnote{\url{https://metaver.de/trefferanzeige?docuuid=A39B4E86-15E2-4BF7-BA82-66F9913D5640}}. The high precision is reached by airborne laser scanning. Downscaled resolutions are available as DGM-10 (10m) and DGM-25 (25m).

To evaluate if the DGM models provide an overall better height profile than SRTM, cross-sections of the height models were analyzed by Max Lorenz preliminarily \cite{lorenz_2022}. Another critical question was how much resources the model consumes when loaded into the routing engine. The results indicated that the DGM-10 model provides the best tradeoff between resource usage and model accuracy. DGM-1 had a higher accuracy than DGM-10, as expected, but the higher accuracy was found not to justify the increased computational resources needed. At the same time, the jump in accuracy from DGM-25 to DGM-10 was justifiable. Thus, the DGM-10 model was integrated as the final digital elevation model into the GraphHopper routing engine using a custom tileset download and parsing plugin.

\subsubsection{Distance-to-Signal Estimation and Mitigating GNSS Inaccuracies}

Focusing further on the applications of the developed routing engine within our GLOSA application, a distance-to-signal estimation method was designed to be more accurate than just taking the direct (linear) distance to the user's position. This method assumes the route closely aligns with the bike infrastructure, ensuring an accurate estimation.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/distance-to-signal-estimation.pdf}
\caption{Distance-to-signal estimation along the route curvature for speed recommendation.}
\label{fig:distance-to-signal-estimation}
\end{figure}

The specific process is highlighted in \Cref{fig:distance-to-signal-estimation}. First, the user's location is snapped to the route geometry, and the subsequent route segments are traversed until reaching the snapped location of the upcoming traffic light. The locations of each traffic light are annotated to the route geometry using the traffic light matching method developed in \Cref{ch:matching}.

Along the precalculated route segments, the distance is determined using the Vincenty estimator, which provides a more accurate distance measure (up to 0.5mm) than the haversine distance through a more accurate representation of the earth's shape while being slightly more computationally expensive. The distances to each traffic light are precalculated along each route segment to optimize the computational overhead further. With this approach, it is only necessary to calculate the distance along the current segment and then add this segment's distance to the next traffic light. The distance estimation process is repeated dynamically each time a new user location is received, updating the current speed advisory.

A second application of the route geometry within the app is for GNSS error correction, which arose not only as one of the significant challenges for GLOSA applications in related work but also during preliminary experiments of the mobile app. Tests conducted in Dresden indicated that older devices (Android 6) struggle more with GNSS drift than newer devices. Even the latest generation of Android and iOS smartphones, configured to provide the highest geolocation accuracy, experience this problem.

Assuming the user strictly follows a predefined route, we can snap the user's location to the route, eliminating orthogonal GNSS scattering. GNSS scattering in the direction of the route is not eliminated. Thus, route snapping alone has the drawback that, when approaching a traffic light slowly, the measured location may jump beyond the traffic light with respect to the route. 

To mitigate this problem, GNSS drift at an intersection is detected as follows: if the user is moving at a GNSS speed less than 2 meters per second, the app reverts to the last traffic light if it is within 10 meters of the user and no other traffic light is closer. If a traffic light is still overshot, the user can manually switch between traffic lights through the application's user interface. Automated rerouting is performed if a user entirely deviates from the designated route. Here, it is essential to avoid triggering rerouting for minor GNSS errors when the user still follows the route accurately.

\subsubsection{Automated Rerouting}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/rerouting-strategy.pdf}
\caption{Schema of the rerouting procedure using a triggering threshold of 50 meters from the route.}
\label{fig:rerouting-strategy}
\end{figure}

The developed rerouting approach operates as illustrated in \Cref{fig:rerouting-strategy}: while the user is on the move, their location is continuously compared to the route by aligning it with the route geometry. The distance between the aligned and actual location is measured against a threshold. When the user moves significantly away from the route, exceeding the threshold, the rerouting is automatically initiated. 

A challenge in this approach is determining the appropriate distance threshold that strikes a balance between prompt rerouting and avoiding unnecessary recalculations. In initial tests conducted in Hamburg, a threshold of 20 meters was used. However, it proved too low, resulting in excessive unnecessary reroutings during field tests. Consequently, the threshold was increased to 50 meters, which yielded a satisfactory balance during our tests.

Another challenge in this approach is identifying the waypoints visited to prevent rerouting back to the starting point. To address this issue, only the remaining waypoints are selected when rerouting is triggered. Initially, the rerouting process involved selecting the nearest waypoint to the user and recalculating the route using that waypoint as a reference. However, this method depicted in \Cref{fig:rerouting-strategy-comparison} on the left was only effective half of the time, assuming the user's location was closer to the upcoming waypoint than the previously visited waypoint. Consequently, this initial strategy often led to unnecessary backtracking.

Another option was snapping the user's location to the route geometry and following that path to find the next waypoint. However, a challenge arose because the waypoints were not directly integrated into the route geometry data structure, which is returned from the routing framework. Although it is possible to align the waypoints with the route geometry for implementation, a simpler and faster approximation was employed in the app, consisting of three steps: (1) Drawing direct lines between waypoints to create a connected path roughly resembling the route. (2) Selecting the nearest line to the user's location. (3) Determining the waypoint at the end of this line as the next waypoint for recalculating the route. This approach assumes that the drawn lines approximately represent the general route structure. With the development of the rerouting approach, we finish our integration of the routing foundation.

\begin{Summary}[Summary of Methods]
To provide accurate bike routing in Hamburg, we investigate the usage of an authoritative dataset for bike infrastructure, DRN. Based on Max Lorenz's concept \cite{lorenz_2022}, we prepare the DRN dataset for routing by translating the path descriptions given in the DRN dataset into the OpenStreetMap format. This allows our routing engine to assign different costs to each path segment depending on its properties, circumventing uncomfortable paths for more sensitive bike types like racing bikes. 

Afterward, we address two specific kinds of issues that were detected in the DRN dataset. Duplicated and slightly misaligned nodes are combined using their center point, and the opposite direction of every path is marked passable if on foot. As a result, routes no longer take long detours to cross a road in case a much closer crossing is available upstream. Finally, we stitch the boundary region of DRN using helper points to allow cross-border routing between OpenStreetMap and DRN. 

The deployment infrastructure utilizes the fully automated processing pipeline to roll out new map material daily. Preheating of the routing engine is employed to accelerate service rollouts. Inclination- and person-sensitive routing is implemented through a menu that allows users to configure their desired options. Afterward, the specific routing profile is mapped from the user's options. The routing profiles make use of the DGM-10 height provider that provides the best resource-accuracy tradeoff, based on preliminary results from an investigation by Max Lorenz \cite{lorenz_2022}. 

To calculate additional information needed for speed advisory, the distance to the next traffic light is extrapolated through the route segments on which the traffic lights and their distances along the route are annotated. Snapping the GNSS position to the next route segment updates the speed advisory through the newly calculated traffic light distance but also eliminates GNSS scattering orthogonal to the route. GNSS scattering along the route is mitigated by detecting situations in which the position erroneously jumps over a traffic light in front of the user. A rerouting is initiated after the user deviates more than 50 meters from the route, selecting the remaining waypoints without inducing unnecessary backtracking to already passed ones. 
\end{Summary}

\section{Results}

Whether our more accurate bike routing goal could be reached will be evaluated in four steps. First, we will investigate the general structure of the processed routing network and compare its completeness to OpenStreetMap. Specifically, we will focus on the path categories that were mapped using our metadata mapping from the DRN format and compare these to the OpenStreetMap network. 

Afterward, a ground truth -- hand-drawn reference tracks -- will help us evaluate how well DRN routes align with actual cycling infrastructure. Here, we will also compare DRN with Google Maps and Bing Maps. We will investigate how many routing errors are encountered by analyzing an arbitrary sample of DRN routes.

In the third part of our evaluation, we will revisit the traffic light matching results from \Cref{ch:matching}, retrain our matching models on a new ground truth, and investigate whether the accuracy can be improved. We further investigate the change in traffic light matching accuracy by studying the alignment between traffic light geometries and DRN routes. In a more coarse-grained study, we also capture routing errors at intersections to find whether the problem of routing on the road instead of bike paths could be resolved. 

After we compare the routing accuracy to a hand-drawn ground truth and traffic light geometries, we validate our results with our users' recorded GNSS trajectories. In this study, we also compare our approach to distance-to-signal estimation with the linear distance approach to find in which situations our approach may perform better or worse. Finally, we will investigate where and how often users deviate from precalculated routes and its relationship to the preselected routing profile.

\subsection{Completeness}\label{sec:lorenz2}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-drn-osm-map.pdf}
\caption{Mapping of path types.}
\label{fig:routing-drn-osm-map}
\end{figure}

Based on an analysis conducted by Max Lorenz \cite{lorenz_2022}, the converted DRN path network encompasses roughly 7689 kilometers compared to OpenStreetMap, which covers approximately 10557 kilometers. The reported coverage for OpenStreetMap excludes paths inaccessible for cyclists, marked with \texttt{highway=motorway}, \texttt{highway=motorway\_line}, \texttt{highway=trunk\_link}, \texttt{access=private}, or \texttt{bi\allowbreak cycle=no}. Footpaths are also excluded unless bicycles are allowed with \texttt{bicycle=yes}. 

The size difference is mainly due to additional accessory paths that are contained in OpenStreetMap but not on DRN. As a consequence, when Max Lorenz \cite{lorenz_2022} generated 10000 random routes throughout the city, the average distance that has to be traveled to the next available path segment varies slightly: 77.04 meters in DRN and 52.80 meters in OpenStreetMap. Even though the DRN network encompasses fewer paths, those captured are more detailed. The average path segment length in OpenStreetMap was measured at 102.39 meters compared to 79.16 meters in DRN.

The structural differences are highlighted in \Cref{fig:routing-drn-osm-map}. Here, OpenStreetMap provides more accessory paths and a higher diversity in path categories than in the mapped DRN network. It can also be seen that DRN tends not to capture ways through green spaces. As a result, one minor drawback is that routes with DRN can be generated until the border of a park area but not inside or throughout. The same applies to intermodal connections such as railroads and ferries, mapped as unclassified paths in the displayed example. DRN does not capture these connections.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-drn-osm-map-surfaces.pdf} 
\caption{Mapping of surface types.}
\label{fig:routing-drn-osm-map-surfaces}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, as seen in \Cref{fig:routing-drn-osm-map-surfaces}, OpenStreetMap contains large proportions of paths with an unclassified surface. Overall, only 66.4\% (7014.52 km) of paths in OpenStreetMap's representation of Hamburg are tagged with a surface instead of 99.9\% (7682.24 km) in the DRN network. However, OpenStreetMap also contains an additional surface quality tag for 783.56 km (7.4\%), which is not mapped by our approach but can be parsed by GraphHopper as an additional source of information to estimate the path speed\footnote{\url{https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/71d2de049f2f4f52453a6fb1b7d558b9f0fa011f/core/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/routing/util/parsers/BikeCommonAverageSpeedParser.java\#L103}}. Other metadata, such as road width, is even rarer in OpenStreetMap, with only 9.2\% (704.47 km) of paths containing this information, in contrast to 99.9\% (7687.69 km) in the DRN routing foundation. An additional property analyzed is the coverage of velo routes, which resides at 1794.55 km in OpenStreetMap and 1149.8 km in DRN. These results are based on Max Lorenz's \cite{lorenz_2022} evaluation.

Despite fewer paths being captured, the DRN network offers more detailed and well-documented path segments, with a higher percentage tagged with surface information, road width, and other valuable metadata. As DRN aims to capture bike paths accurately to their actual position, it is generally not a problem if intermodal connections are not contained. However, a higher coverage of green spaces and accessory paths could be desirable. 

\subsection{Alignment with Actual Bike Paths}\label{sec:routing-alignment}\label{sec:lorenz3}

To measure the alignment of generated bike routes with actual cycling infrastructure, we create a separate ground truth by hand-drawing reference bike paths with the help of satellite imagery. Although we will not reach centimeter-level accuracy with this method, it will help measure general misalignments in the bike routes we previously encountered. This method generally assumes relatively recent satellite image tiles aligned well with the actual position using an appropriate projection.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-hand-drawn-ground-truth.pdf}
\caption{Best-fit routes for each routing provider in relation to the hand-drawn ground truth.}
\label{fig:routing-hand-drawn-ground-truth}
\end{figure}

As part of Max Lorenz's work \cite{lorenz_2022}, six reference tracks were created, containing three pairs of routes running in opposite directions: one from east to west and one from west to east. These reference tracks are depicted in \Cref{fig:routing-hand-drawn-ground-truth} as red cross-marks. Afterward, routes are generated by the map providers and compared for alignment with the reference geometry. The results from Max Lorenz's work \cite{lorenz_2022}, which were focused on a comparison between DRN and OpenStreetMap, are augmented with Google Maps and Bing Maps as other alternative route providers.

Although it would be possible to use corresponding map-matching APIs here, the intention is to emulate user behavior in creating waypoints and check whether the generated route matches the reference geometry. In this experiment, we assume that the user wants to follow the reference geometry as accurately as possible.

One challenge during this process is a curved reference geometry such as \texttt{3\_West\_Ost}, which tends to be shortcutted via a more direct connection between start and endpoints. Thus, assuming that a user wants to follow the reference track, the number of waypoints is gradually increased from 2 to 10 using the same waypoint interpolation across all compared providers. In each step, the alignment is measured, ultimately taking the best fit out of all attempts to give each provider multiple chances at generating the most accurate route. In this way, not only the best alignment is measured, but also the tendency to deviate from an intended route even when new waypoints are added, indicating the user's intention.

\caption{Measured deviations from actual bike infrastructure. DRN and OpenStreetMap results (Hausdorff distance and mean distance) were reproduced from \cite{lorenz_2022}}%
\label{tab:accuracy-comparison}%
\end{table}

The alignment is measured by two metrics: the Hausdorff distance, an established measure to calculate two geometries' shapes, and the mean distance, as calculated through the Vincenty estimator, accurate up to 0.5mm. Based on Max Lorenz's \cite{lorenz_2022} method, the Hausdorff distance is calculated through the Shapely\footnote{\url{https://github.com/shapely/shapely}} Python library in the EPSG:32633\footnote{\url{https://epsg.io/32633}} projection that utilizes meters as a distance unit. In our extended study, it is also utilized as a reference to determine the best-fitting route. To measure detours and the overall estimation quality of path length, we also calculate the difference in length, subtracting the length of the reference geometry from the route's length, again using the Vincenty estimator. Here, negative values indicate an underestimation, and positive values indicate an overestimation of the actual path length.

As depicted in \Cref{fig:routing-hand-drawn-ground-truth}, four routing providers are compared: our method DRN, OpenStreetMap using a GraphHopper, the Bing Maps routing API\footnote{\url{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/routes/calculate-a-route}}, and the Google Maps routing API\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes/reference/rest/v2/TopLevel/computeRoutes}}. For DRN and OpenStreetMap, the GraphHopper routing profile \texttt{bike2} is utilized. For Google Maps, \texttt{travelMode=\allowbreak BICYCLE} is selected. Bing Maps is utilized by the modes \texttt{Driving} and \texttt{Walking} as no bike mode was available to determine which option is the best proxy for a bike route.

The best fits are highlighted in \Cref{fig:routing-hand-drawn-ground-truth}. In example (b), it can be seen that the DRN bike route aligns almost perfectly with the hand-drawn reference track. The OpenStreetMap route generated by GraphHopper tends to switch between the bike path and the center of the road -- a behavior seen before in \Cref{ch:matching} with this routing foundation. However, OpenStreetMap is still closer to the bike infrastructure than Google and Bing Maps routing profiles. In this case, choosing the \texttt{Walking} profile for Bing Maps seems to make no significant difference in whether the footpath is chosen.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-convergence-process.pdf}
\caption{Visualization of routing convergence depending on the number of waypoints interpolated along the desired trajectory.}
\label{fig:routing-convergence-process}
\end{figure}

Both commercial providers, Bing Maps and Google Maps, produce a less detailed geometry in the given example. Minor bends are not captured. \Cref{tab:accuracy-comparison} shows that the observations from the case study also align with our numerical measurements. As DRN produces no detours in this sample and captures minor road bends contained in the reference material, its estimated path length aligns closely with the actual path length as represented by our hand-drawn trajectories. Except for \texttt{1\_Ost\_West}, on which OpenStreetMap achieves the best Hausdorff and mean distances, DRN performs substantially better in depicting bike infrastructure than all other routing foundations in the studied examples. Under the remaining routing foundations, OpenStreetMap seems to provide the generally most accurate depiction. Both \texttt{Walking} and \texttt{Driving} routing profiles for Bing Maps produce similar results.

Based on the number of waypoints DRN required to achieve the best fit, it converges faster on the desired trajectory than the other routing foundations. As shown in \Cref{fig:routing-convergence-process}, only the first one or two routes providing two or three waypoints, respectively, deviate from the intended path in DRN. DRN requires four waypoints to snap to the desired paths in one example that is also challenging for other routing foundations, \texttt{3\_West\_Ost}.

Overall, OpenStreetMap quickly converges the desired paths in these examples as well. However, it is also more unstable when additional waypoints are added to the trajectory in some cases and produce visibly unnecessary detours. The same behavior can be seen with the other routing foundations, especially Google Maps, which did not want to converge fully onto the \texttt{1\_Ost\_West} trajectory no matter the number of waypoints, inserting a significant detour instead. Bing Maps also inserted visibly unnecessary detours. 

This first study already gives us some initial insights into the accuracy of the routing foundations. However, there are also some aspects to consider. Assuming the seen issues originated in a non-captured path within the routing foundations, we could have picked bad examples here by accident. Thus, the unnecessary detours may not be seen on all routes. To rule this aspect out, we would need a larger sample size. Addressing this issue, we will conduct larger-scale quality comparisons in the following sections.

\subsection{Alignment with Traffic Light Geometries} \label{sec:lorenz4}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/matching-ground-truth-drn.pdf}
\caption{DRN 2023 traffic light matching ground truth.}
\label{fig:matching-ground-truth-drn}
\end{figure}

As discussed in \Cref{ch:matching}, georeferenced intersection topologies provide the foundation for traffic light matching in this work. Each intersection topology contains ingress, connection, and egress lane shapes for each traffic light. Since the traffic light geometries are designed to depict turn shapes at intersections as accurately as possible, they provide another option to evaluate the alignment of the developed routing network with a particular focus on intersections. A close alignment is desired to enhance the accuracy of traffic light matching.

As only one or a few traffic lights may match a given bike route at an intersection, we cannot directly compare all traffic light geometries with the routing foundation. As we have seen in \Cref{ch:matching}, many traffic lights are never a good option in the presence of a better alternative aligning closer with the bike path. Thus, we first calculate bike routes with DRN and manually select fitting traffic light geometries. Afterward, we can compare the traffic light geometries to the corresponding route to measure their alignment. 

The DRN traffic light matching ground truth was developed according to the rules and methods explained detailedly in \Cref{ch:matching}. The resulting mapping between generated DRN routes and traffic light geometries is depicted in \Cref{fig:matching-ground-truth-drn}. It contains 49 routes randomly distributed in Hamburg, for which 738 traffic light geometries out of 4964 in proximity (20m) to the route have been selected to match the route geometry. These 738 selections can be mapped to 535 distinct traffic lights that were assigned to at least one route. 78.5\% (420) of all traffic lights were assigned to only one route, indicating a high sample diversity.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-lane-alignment.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of traffic light geometry alignment with DRN and OpenStreetMap routes.}
\label{fig:routing-lane-alignment}
\end{figure}

Comparing the selected traffic lights to their assigned route geometries, the DRN routes are closer aligned than their OpenStreetMap counterpart. This result can be seen in \Cref{fig:routing-lane-alignment} where we compare our OpenStreetMap traffic light matching ground truths developed in \Cref{ch:matching} to the newly developed DRN ground truth. 

More matching traffic light geometries reside directly over the DRN route, compared to the distribution of distances between route and traffic light geometries in OpenStreetMap, which is much more evened out. Although the discrepancy between traffic light geometries and the generated bike routes is substantially lower, the maximum distance distribution indicates that a perfect overlap is still not given. A more advanced matching strategy than a simple proximity-based lookup is still required for these examples with imperfect alignments. Nonetheless, the measured alignment represents a substantial improvement over the OpenStreetMap approach. 

\begin{table}[b]

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\label{tab:hyperparameter-tuning-results-drn}
\end{table}

In the next experiment, we assess whether this improvement positively impacts the matching accuracy. First, we retrain the algorithmic matching model on the newly created ground truth. The hyperparameter configuration identified through hyperparameter optimization is compared to that of the OpenStreetMap models in \Cref{tab:hyperparameter-tuning-results-drn}. Notably, the optimization tool applied stricter thresholds than those employed in OpenStreetMap. These stricter thresholds result in quicker dismissal of traffic light geometries that do not align well with the route.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:model-scores-drn}
\end{table}

Following the methodology outlined in \Cref{ch:matching}, the machine learning model is retrained on the DRN ground truth using stratified k-fold cross-validation. During training, the machine learning model achieved an F1 score of 95.83\% and a test score of 90.94\%. While the training score improves by nearly two percentage points, the test score is approximately 1\% lower than that achieved on the 2022 OpenStreetMap dataset. 

However, here, it must be considered that the cross-validation test-split score on OpenStreetMap was calculated using much fewer traffic lights, 2414 instead of 5168, due to the ongoing addition of new traffic lights to the system. With the fewer possible constellations between traffic light geometries and routes, it is easier than the 2023 OpenStreetMap dataset, which also encompasses 5168 traffic lights. Thus, the 2023 DRN test-split score is better compared with the machine learning model's 2023 OpenStreetMap score, which is also calculated on unseen data. Using the values listed in \Cref{tab:model-scores-drn}, the F1 score improved from 86.2\% to 90.94\% -- an improvement of 4.74\%. 

Notably, when tested on the complete dataset, the machine learning model's recall is at 97\%, indicating that false positives during traffic light matching with DRN are rare. The algorithmic model also demonstrates improvement, surpassing its previous best result on the OpenStreetMap dataset from 2022 by 3.2\%, achieving an 88.0\% accuracy on DRN. 

The measurable improvement in routing accuracy is evident in the enhanced strictness of the algorithmic model and an overall improved matching accuracy. This means that the matching is easier for the models with DRN routing.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/matching-constellations-osm-vs-drn.pdf} \\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/matching-route-errors-osm-vs-drn.pdf}
\caption{Tagged routing errors and constellations between traffic light geometries and routes in DRN relative to the OpenStreetMap results.}
\label{fig:matching-constellations-osm-vs-drn}
\end{figure}

As depicted in \Cref{fig:matching-constellations-osm-vs-drn}, there are nearly twice as many instances in DRN where the route geometry closely aligns with the traffic light geometry. Notably, route deviations from the traffic light geometry occur less frequently, especially in cases where the route directs onto the road despite the availability of a bicycle lane, a scenario where matching errors were nearly eliminated. 

A similar difference is observed in situations where the route turns but runs offset to the route, a case handled better by the machine learning model in the DRN dataset than the algorithmic model. However, a new error situation emerges, particularly when the route closely aligns with the traffic light geometry. This suggests room for improvement in the matching procedure in such cases.

An examination of routing errors, categorized into four classes during ground truth creation, reveals a significant enhancement. Instances without routing errors nearly tripled, rising from 23\% (241 out of 1035 constellations marked) in OpenStreetMap to 60\% (438 out of 731 constellations marked) in DRN. This improvement primarily stems from more accurate utilization of bike lanes and paths, reducing routing in the middle of the road. However, complete elimination of this scenario was not achieved. Moreover, routing on the wrong side of the street occurs less frequently.

A detailed case study analyzing 72 random routes by Max Lorenz \cite{lorenz_2022} confirms these findings, as depicted in \Cref{tab:error-cases-max-lorenz}. This validation study further supports the notable improvement in routing quality, marked by fewer identified errors. Continuous routing on the bicycle path contributes significantly to this improvement, along with mitigated occurrences of less common errors such as routing through impassable obstacles, buildings, and stairs.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrr@{}}
\hline
\textbf{Observed Error Cases} & \textbf{DRN} & \textbf{OSM} \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Observed error cases among an arbitrary sample of 72 routes. Source: \cite{lorenz_2022}}%
\label{tab:error-cases-max-lorenz}%
\end{table}

In conclusion, the DRN routes closely align with bicycle infrastructure and exhibit enhanced alignment with traffic light geometries compared to OpenStreetMap bicycle routes. The results suggest that this alignment improvement positively influences traffic light matching. Substantial reductions in routing error rates at intersections and fewer errors in examining entire route geometries further support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

\subsection{Alignment with User Trajectories}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-reroutes-distribution.pdf}
\caption{Reroutes triggered during user rides.}
\label{fig:routing-reroutes-distribution}
\end{figure}

Finally, we assess the alignment of the DRN network with user journeys and examine how well the route-based estimated distance to the traffic light matches the distance to be covered compared to the direct straight-line distance. Based on 1327 user tracks recorded during the Beta period in 2023, covering a total distance of 6716.03 km, rerouting was triggered 7030 times, with reroutings occurring every 1.39 km in the median. In 20.27\% of journeys, no rerouting was triggered. As seen in \Cref{fig:routing-reroutes-distribution}, reroutes are more frequently triggered directly after the ride has started or shortly before the ride is finished.

By overlaying the GNSS trajectories of users onto both routing networks, we can determine whether the actual positions align more closely with the OpenStreetMap network or the DRN network. It is important to note again that GNSS positions naturally vary around the actual position. However, considering the mass of tracks, we should observe a discernible trend, assuming GNSS approximates a normal distribution around the actual position and systematic effects like GNSS drift are negligible in the variety of tracks.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-mapmatching-distance.pdf}
\caption{Alignment of user trajectories with DRN and OpenStreetMap paths.}
\label{fig:routing-mapmatching-distance}
\end{figure}

The results are plotted in \Cref{fig:routing-mapmatching-distance}, depicting two intersections in the central area of Hamburg, chosen to minimize identifiable personal references in the tracks. Despite the visible scattering of GNSS positions, it is evident that the recorded cycling trajectories align significantly better with the DRN path network than with OpenStreetMap.

To provide a more comprehensive comparison of all trajectories with the routing network, we perform an aggregated comparison using the GraphHopper map matching API\footnote{\url{https://docs.graphhopper.com/\#tag/Map-Matching-API}}, employing the method proposed by Newson and Krumm \cite{newson_hidden_2009} on both OpenStreetMap and DRN. Subsequently, we measure the distance from each GNSS point using the Vincenty estimator to the nearest map-matched segment.

The results reveal two half-normal distributions: DRN positions at a median distance of 2.90m from the nearest path and OpenStreetMap positions at 4.41m. The dispersion in DRN is notably lower, with an interquartile range of 5.40m compared to 7.09m in OpenStreetMap. This underscores the more accurate and consistent representation of bicycle paths in DRN. Consequently, our proposed GNSS correction, facilitated through snapping onto the route, is likely less distorted with DRN routes.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-gnss-mapmatching-distribution.pdf}
\caption{Distance of each GNSS sample in user trajectories when map-matched onto DRN and OpenStreetMap networks.}
\label{fig:routing-gnss-mapmatching-distribution}
\end{figure}

To evaluate our approach for distance-to-signal estimation, we compare the distance estimated for each GNSS sample to the measured distance driven to the next traffic light. We calculate the distance by determining the position at which the GNSS trajectory will pass the matched upcoming traffic light. Then, we trace the GNSS trajectory back to the current position and measure the Vincenty distance along the backtracked path. GNSS samples not having an upcoming traffic light, e.g., at the end of a track, are not considered here. This method assumes that cases in which users preliminarily deviate from their intended path over the traffic light are sufficiently rare and that the correct traffic light is matched sufficiently often. The GNSS is also expected to scatter in a normal distribution, slightly increasing the measured ground truth distance over the actual traveled distance. Thus, gaussian noise in the measurement is intended.

Aggregating the measured differences in \Cref{fig:routing-distance-distribution}, we can see that both methods for distance estimation, our route-based method and the direct distance from the current position, center around the zero-line that indicates a perfect distance estimation. In some cases, both methods over- or underestimate the distance to the next traffic light. However, it can also be seen that the direct distance estimation tends to underestimate the actual distance in noticeably more cases, as expected. Calculating the median of both distributions, the route-based distance estimation underestimates the distance by 0.53 meters for each GNSS sample, while the direct measurement underestimates the distance by 3.41 meters. A slight underestimation is expected here due to the GNSS scattering.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-distance-distribution.pdf}
\caption{Under- and overestimation of distance-to-signal estimation approaches compared to the actual distance traveled, as extrapolated through the actual GNSS trajectory.}
\label{fig:routing-distance-distribution}
\end{figure}

A more noticeable difference arises when calculating the interquartile ranges of the distributions. In at least 25\% of cases, the direct distance underestimates the actual traffic light distance by at least 24.47 meters, while the route-based distance estimation only underestimates by at least 5.87 meters. On the other hand, an overestimation is quite rare with the direct distance approach. In at least 25\% of cases, the direct distance approach only overestimates by at least 0.33 meters, while the route-based approach overestimates at least 4.36 meters. Nonetheless, the skewness of the direct distance approach's distribution and the more extensive interquartile range clearly show that the route-based approach provides a more even and stable distance estimation.

In the previous experiment, we considered every GNSS sample equally. However, distance estimation is likely more challenging when far from the traffic light due to the chance of additional road bends until the traffic light is reached. 

A view of the over- and underestimation in relation to the actual traffic light distance, as depicted in \Cref{fig:routing-distance-scatter}, reveals among the expected noisiness that the direct distance estimation tends to underestimate more with increased distances to the traffic light, confirming initial expectations. While the route-based distance estimation tends to align around a perfect estimation even for higher distances, the direct distance approach tends to "bend down," supporting the hypothesis of a decreased accuracy with higher distances. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-distance-scatter.pdf}
\caption{Under- and overestimation depending on the actual distance traveled toward the traffic light, as extrapolated through the actual GNSS trajectory.}
\label{fig:routing-distance-scatter}
\end{figure}

The black triangle on the lower left section of both plots indicates the area where the actual distance to the traffic light limits the underestimation. Other exciting patterns arise in the diagonal artifacts, which are visible with the route-based distance estimation approach. These lines likely indicate situations where users deviated using an orthogonally aligned side road from the route, considering the parallelity and similar running direction of these artifacts. With the direct-distance approach, the visible artifacts running from below toward the horizontal centerline indicate situations in which utilized ingress roads bend away from a straight line between the user and the traffic light, supporting the assumption that there are such situations in which road bends play a role for distance estimation.

Overall, the initial assumptions concerning the accuracy of a direct-distance approach could be further explored, indicating many situations in which a route-based approach is a better option for distance-to-signal estimation.

So far, we have evaluated how our DRN bike routing foundation's accuracy, error-freeness, and consistency have improved, particularly over OpenStreetMap. However, what has not been considered is the overall route length. This property is also essential as users want to reach their destination in a reasonably short way. As seen in the concept section, additional measures were required to diminish detours due to the separate depiction of bike paths on both roadsides and no interconnections. 

In theory, we could evaluate the route length based on a random and, thus, representative sample of routes throughout the city, as we have done in previous sections. However, another interesting property would be investigating the general route length driven by the application users. Assuming a sufficient diversity in the user trajectories, we will combine both evaluations by calculating routes between the start and end GNSS points of all recorded 1327 user trajectories. Routes are calculated using the same map providers and routing profiles as in \Cref{sec:routing-alignment}.

As presented in \Cref{fig:routing-distance-comparison}, routes generated with DRN are minimally longer than OpenStreetMap routes. Measured by the median distance summed along all route segments using the Vincenty estimator, DRN routes are 4058 meters long (IQR: 4003m) compared to OpenStreetMap with 3907 meters (IQR: 3829m). Here, it needs to be considered that the segment length of DRN is also shorter at 25.93 meters (IQR: 6.76m) in relation to 36.57 meters (IQR: 10.62m) in OpenStreetMap. Thus, parts of this increased distance could also come from a more accurate depiction of road curviness. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/routing-distance-comparison.pdf}
\caption{Route length and segment length comparison between routing providers.}
\label{fig:routing-distance-comparison}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{Driving} profile of Bing Maps performs substantially worse, with a median route length of 4734 meters (IQR: 4224m), compared to the \texttt{Walking} profile, which seems to produce much shorter routes at a median of 3755 meters (IQR: 3759m). Although Bing Maps produces the shortest routes with the \texttt{Walking} profile, it must be considered here that we cannot verify whether the used shortcuts are accessible to cyclists. Furthermore, the route segment length in Bing Maps is also worse, with a median of 110.21 meters (\texttt{Driving}, IQR: 37.99m) or 87.57 meters (\texttt{Walking}, IQR: 45.57m), respectively. These results suggest that the depiction of road bends and intersection traversals is also less optimal, potentially negatively impacting a traffic light matching that depends on the turn shape's geometrical details. 

Although detours have been detected in \Cref{sec:routing-alignment} with Google Maps, they may be less prevalent than our initial case study suggested. However, they still seem to exist. The bike routes from Google Maps are 1.4\% longer than DRN, residing at a median of 4114 meters (IQR: 3703m). Google Maps' segment length is comparable to OpenStreetMap, with a median segment length of 40.61m (IQR: 15.63m). Thus, considering overall route length, Google Maps takes place three after DRN and OpenStreetMap. However, DRN is clearly the best option regarding the detailedness of path geometries.

\begin{Summary}[Summary and Discussion of Results]
Based on Max Lorenz's results \cite{lorenz_2022}, the DRN routing foundation covers less distance than bikeable paths in OpenStreetMap since some types of accessory paths are omitted, requiring users to travel 77m instead of 53m to the next available path segment. Thus, it may be desirable to supplement accessory paths from OpenStreetMap or request this information to be included. The consistency of metainformation is noticeably higher in DRN compared to OpenStreetMap, with almost 100\% coverage and no unclassified paths. Overlaps are seen after the metadata mapping, while OpenStreetMap has a more extensive diversity of path classifications if provided.

Compared to six hand-drawn reference tracks, our routing foundation provides the closest alignment with actual cyclist infrastructure, with average routes residing within one to two meters of the reference track. Commercial providers Bing Maps and Google Maps align less well with the bike paths than OpenStreetMap. For Bing Maps, both \texttt{Cycling} and \texttt{Walking} profiles were evaluated since no bike profile is available. Unnecessary detours are seen with most providers, while the DRN routing converges quickly onto a desired trajectory. 

Based on a newly created ground truth, DRN routes align much more closely with traffic light geometries, as initially suspected. The retrained Machine Learning model for traffic light matching could be improved by 4.74\% to an F1 score of 90.94\% on unseen data, compared to 86.2\% achieved with the previous model. On the complete DRN dataset, an F1 score of 94\% (+2\%) and a low false-positive rate of 97\% (+3\%) were achieved. A likely source of improvement is fewer bike routing errors (-41\% of cases) and fewer offsets between routes and traffic light geometries. A study of 72 randomly generated bike routes by Max Lorenz \cite{lorenz_2022} validates that fewer routing errors are encountered.

The general alignment with the user's position is also enhanced, decreasing the overall distance for user position snapping as performed for GNSS error correction. Estimating the distance over the route instead of over the air aligns better with the actual traveled distance, especially when far away from the traffic light. Deviations from the routes can be seen in the 1327 investigated user tracks by a rate of one rerouting per 1.39 km. Compared to OpenStreetMap, Bing Maps, and Google Maps, DRN bike routes generated along trajectories driven by users take second place w.r.t. route length and provide a more detailed depiction of the path curvature.

\section{Conclusions}

Accurate bike routing is required for several application scenarios, not only in GLOSA applications. However, OpenStreetMap, a common routing foundation that also contains bike paths, is known for its varying consistency, completeness, and accuracy levels. Commercial alternatives such as Google Maps or Bing Maps are not necessarily better. In this chapter, we investigated one potential solution to the problem: routing on an authoritative bike paths dataset. These datasets have been utilized in related work primarily to analyze existing routing foundations, only rarely to route on them directly. Existing approaches focus on hybridization on the path level, which comes with the challenge of deciding whether each path geometry should be contained in the final network. Thus, automatization and quality assurance have been a considerable challenge. 

In Hamburg, we have a fortunate situation since the authoritative dataset DRN contains not only individual paths but also an interconnected graph of all bikeable ways. This chapter aimed to develop methods for incorporating such patches of reference map material into a routing service. Stitching the path network at its boundary with OpenStreetMap allows for cross-border routing and lifts the spatial limitation of the dataset, providing the option to integrate further patches from authoritative datasets one by one. We focused on fully automating the network's conversion, including metadata mapping, automated error correction, equipment with a resource-efficient height provider (DGM-10), and integration in a continuous integration pipeline, ensuring up-to-date map material. Finally, we investigated how the routing foundation is utilized in the bike-GLOSA app for GNSS error correction and how automated rerouting is performed. Where previous works have also not contributed more detailed discussions on distance-to-signal estimation, we have developed a route-based approach that aims to be more accurate than simply taking the over-the-air distance. 

With minor omissions of accessory paths, the developed routing foundation provides a significantly higher level of metadata consistency. Comparing generated routes to hand-drawn reference tracks reveals that the alignment with actual cycling infrastructure is also enhanced compared to OpenStreetMap, Bing Maps, and Google Maps. Users can expect a good route convergence between waypoints along the intended trajectory. Through the more accurate alignment and substantially fewer routing errors, the F1 score for the developed traffic light matching model could be improved by 4.74\% on unseen data. Routing errors are reduced by 41\%. Significant issues regarding detours were not encountered considering a median route length of 4058 meters along tracks driven by users, compared to 3907m for OpenStreetMap, 4734m (\texttt{Driving}) and 3755m (\texttt{Walking}) for Bing Maps, as well as 4114m for Google Maps. However, some improvement is still possible here, considering that OpenStreetMap routes are 3.9\% shorter by median length. The detailedness of the route geometry is improved with a shorter segment length, benefitting route-based distance-to-signal estimation and traffic light matching that depend on a good depiction of road curvature.

The developed routing foundation demonstrates the benefits of routing on an authoritative dataset and can be reused for multiple kinds of applications in Hamburg. However, there are also limitations to consider. Firstly, we have claimed the goal of making our concept reusable for other authoritative datasets. While reuse is generally possible, it must be considered that we assume a fully connected graph of bike paths. Our literature study found a large variety of authoritative dataset formats and completeness. Thus, our methods and results may need further consideration for other authoritative datasets or modes of transport. Although our method is designed for full automation, a human-controlled quality assurance process along the running solution is still required. Occasionally, missing or false geometries may not be corrected as quickly as possible using a volunteered map foundation. In any case, integrating the DRN dataset can be considered highly successful in many ways in the context of the developed bike-GLOSA application.
